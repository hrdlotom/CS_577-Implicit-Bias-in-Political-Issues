A heavily armed populace gives rise to all sorts of risks. The school-shootings, whilst relatively rare, do highlight a consistent failure on the part of successive US governments to address how easy it is for anyone to get hold of a gun and also highlights a failure to instruct people on the proper care and security of their weapons. I once had a discussion with a gun-owner who said that if someone broke into his house in the dead of night, he would feel much better equipped to defend himself as he had a gun, and would quite readily put a bullet into the intruder. I then pointed out that it could be his son coming home late from a night out, perhaps drunk, making a bit of noise, and that he ran the risk of shooting his child- because after all, you have to react quickly when faced with an intruder. He didn't have a response to that.
I would not necessarily argue for a complete ban on firearms in a country where firearms have been part of the culture for as long as that country has existed, but tighter controls will lead to less school-shootings and better education will lead to people being more aware of the dangerous weapon they have in their home. I think far too many gun owners grow complacent about their ability to defend themselves, simply because they have a gun in their home, when after all, in a country where ownership of a gun is easy to achieve, the criminals usually have a bigger, better gun.",9,1,"Citizens should not have the right to own guns"

There is no logic to that argument. The guy had the most common gun, and he obtained it legally. It wasn't too easy to get, and it wasn't the cause of the tragedy. He was. He could have bought them illegally if he wanted to. He gave two forms of ID, and a credit card, went through a background check, and waited to get the gun, like everyone else. I would ask what you would suggest on top of that? Putting up collateral like your house in the event that you kill someone...which, your house will already be taken away if you did kill someone, and were convicted. But if you were going to commit suicide afterwards and you're obviously crazy, what d you care? And if you're willing to kill 31 people, you're also willing to get a gun illegally. There is no test for "crazy", so you just never know. So what do you suggest? Making guns illegal? That would work about as good as prohibition did. The FACT is, senseless violence, and terrorism is easy, and any reaction to it is just fluff. Terrorist act on airplane = beef up airport security with guards. Guy shoots people on campus = every campus now needs a swat team. The truth of the matter is anyone can kill any number of people at anytime. All it takes is the right mindset to do it. Guards in an airport stops people from getting on planes, but killing hundreds of people in an airport would make the same impact, and would be just as easy.

You say 100 people die every day of guns in the US. There are 301 million people in the US. We have 10,800 people born every day in the US according to the US Cencus. So less than 1% of the people born each die of guns at all in the us.

Just look at the Declaration of Independence, the wording and language used is one that justifies the how the constitution came to be.
Why is it that for our founding fathers of this nation, the right to speech ranks as number one, followed by the "right to bear arms"?
Now granted, an argument could be made that the 2nd amendment guarantees the "right to bear arms" for a "well regulated militia" and not necessarily to citizens. Granted that's the a different argument about what constitutes a well regulated militia (e.g., is a well regulated militia an standing army or merely citizens).
Somehow I don't believe that the founding fathers would "limit" which "arms" could be used. It would be rather stupid and silly for an uprising to use sticks and stones against a tyrannical army equipped with fully automatic assault rifles.
As for weapons of mass destruction, a pistol is hardly a WMD. Heck even assault rifles aren't WMD. You would have to go to something really nasty (e.g.., nukes, dirty bombs, lots of explosives, chemical bombs in enclosed spaces, and biological weapons). All of which are pretty hard to manufacture without someone noticing with the exception of the lots of explosives (i.e., Oklahoma City Bombing).
Now for the last point, how does one use a weapon against the U.S. Government and not on a civilian? Have we recently decided to draft non-citizens to serve in our armies? That argument of only being able to use weapons (e.g., guns) on the U.S. Government but not civilians is like my army buddy's policy of using a .50 caliber weapon to shoot the "equipment" of enemy soldiers.
FYI, a .50 caliber weapon doesn't need to hit you to inflict bodily damage. Next a .50 caliber weapon is restricted to anti-armor weapons (e.g., weapons to be used against tanks) and it is against the Geneva Convictions to use a anti-armor weapon on people.",9,1,"Despite the tragedy at VT, there should NOT be tighter gun control laws."

Media Ignore Fact That Gun Owners Stopped Law School Shooter
By Phil Brennan NewsMax.com
2-2-2
Two of the three Virginia law students who overpowered a gunman in a fatal school shooting were armed and used their weapons to disarm the shooter. Yet of the 280 stories written about the shooting, a mere four mentioned the fact that the heroic students were armed and used their guns to halt the rampage.
That's according to Dr. John Lott, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute and the author of the widely acclaimed book "More Guns, Less Crime."
Writing in Friday's edition of the New York Post, Lott reported on last week's shooting at Appalachian School of Law. Nigerian student Peter Odighizuwa is accused of killing the dean, L. Anthony Sutin, 42 - a former acting assistant U.S. attorney general and campaign worker for Bill Clinton - professor Thomas Blackwell, 41, and student Angela Denise Dales, 33.
Noting that the rampage was widely covered in the world's media, Lott wrote: "As usual, there were calls for more gun control.
"Yet in this age of 'gun-free school zones,' the vast majority of news reports ignored the fact that the attack was stopped by two students who had guns in their cars. The quick response by two of the students, Mikael Gross, 34, and Tracy Bridges, 25, undoubtedly saved multiple lives," Lott reported.
According to Lott: Having just returned from lunch, Gross was outside the law school building when Odighizuwa began shooting. Bridges was inside, waiting for class to start.
When the sound of shooting erupted, panic ensued. "People were running everywhere. They were jumping behind cars, running out in front of traffic, trying to get away," Gross said.
Instead of joining in the chaos, Gross and Bridges ran to their cars and got their guns. Joined by an unarmed Ted Besen, an ex-Marine and police officer, the three men approached the shooter from different sides.
"I aimed my gun at him, and Peter tossed his gun down," Bridges recalled. "Ted approached Peter, and Peter hit Ted in the jaw. Ted pushed him back, and we all jumped on."
Wrote Lott: "What is so remarkable is that out of 280 separate news stories (from a computerized Nexis-Lexis search) in the week after the event, just four stories mentioned that the students who stopped the attack had guns.
"Only two local newspapers (the Richmond Times-Dispatch and the Charlotte Observer) mentioned that the students actually pointed their guns at the attacker."
Lott cited the liberal, anti-gun Washington Post, which reported that the heroes had simply "helped subdue" the killer. The leftist, anti-gun New York Times, not surprisingly, noted only that the attacker was "tackled by fellow students."
"Most in the media who discussed how the attack was stopped said: 'students overpowered a gunman,' 'students ended the rampage by tackling him,' 'the gunman was tackled by four male students before being arrested,' or 'Students ended the rampage by confronting and then tackling the gunman, who dropped his weapon.'"
Such selective reporting is not unusual, Lott noted. "In the other public school shootings where citizens with guns have stopped attacks, rarely do more than 1 percent of the news stories mention that citizens with guns stopped the attacks."
Wall of Silence
Lott cited research showing there are 2 million defensive gun uses each year. "After all, if these events were really happening, wouldn't we hear about them on the news? But when was the last time you saw a story on the national evening news (or even the local news) about a citizen using his gun to stop a crime?"
Such "misreporting actually endangers people's lives," Lott concluded. "By selectively reporting the news and turning a defensive gun use story into one where students merely 'overpowered a gunman' the media gives misleading impressions of what works when people are confronted by violence.
"Research consistently shows that having a gun is the safest way to respond to any type of criminal attack, especially these multiple victim shootings."

"Waters points out that while a school shooting warrants national coverage, a woman who shoots and kills a serial rapist is only local news. (He aptly points out that in one school shooting, where the principal apprehended the shooter, he did so only because he, too, had a gun - a fact conveniently left out by most of the press.)
He also notes that, though there are a few well-publicized shooting at schools each year, at least 700,000 times and perhaps over two million times a year, average American citizens, like you and like me, use a firearm to protect themselves, their families, friends, and sometimes complete strangers from criminal predators. At times the trigger is pulled, but more often the mere showing of a gun is enough to run the hoodlum off. "

"For every time a gun in the home is used in a self-defense homicide, a gun will be used in—

Let's take another look, too. You're talking apples and oranges, and anyone will see that if they take more than a quick glance.

2. homicide
Well, how about:
1. not in the home, not homicide?
2. not in the home, homicide?
3. in the home, not homicide?
4. pulling a gun out--in the home or not--and NOT pulling the trigger?
Nothing like trying to distort reality, eh?

As for why the framers of the bill of Rights incorporated the right to bear arms is debatable. I think you are only partially correct about the reason though. Just as they did not anticipate the kind of weapons we have today, they also didn't envision cops on every corner with a donut shop. ignoring crack addicts whacking little old ladies to steal their bus fare.

2803,"gun control","This shows exactly how little you know about people and guns. "If everybody had guns" is one of those beloved terms that makes the situation sound like the wild west. Yet statistically it has been proven that states that have concealed carry laws show a marked reduction in violent crime. The shooter at VT stood out in the open, unafraid of retribution, because he was the only person with a gun. He picked his victims and killed them. HE KILLED THEM, not the gun. The laws forbidding guns on campus did nothing to help the victims. The "Trained profesionals" were nowhere to be found to protect the victims. People who go through the vetting process to have a concealed carry permit are trained on how and when to use the gun. They do not seak out the opportunity! They would rather avoid it. You have insurance on your car. Do you actively go out looking to have an accident? Of course not, unless you are unstable. But wait, that would put you in the same class as the shooter, we better start outlawing cars as well.
Can you see the point I am trying to make? The shooter at VT was not afraid of being shot at, he KNEW he was safe. HE was breaking the law with the intent in taking life and he KNEW he was safe. Gun laws did nothing to protect those people, it cost them their lives.",9,1,"Despite the tragedy at VT, there should NOT be tighter gun control laws."
756,"gun control","These laws are already in place. The problem is not the laws the problem is the people that own the guns. We need to look closer at what causes these people to do these things. Why did this one kid that came from a well off family suddenly decide that he was going to walk through his school shooting people. Why did those students in the other schools over the years suddenly decide that they needed to walk through the school with there daddy's guns and start shooting people.
We have never looked into why these people are doing these violent acts. we simply start pointing fingers and blaming TV, Video Games and Movies. We never truly find the cause, we never look at the family structure or the environment that they lived in or the people that they hung around. We simply take the word of the family "He was a good kid". Did these parents even know what there children were doing, obviously not. If they had played an active role in there life then they would have stopped this before it even started. The excuse that "We were giving him his space" will not work.
The guy at V-Tech I considered to be an adult. He should have known better. So now we are looking at why he went off his rocker. Why did the teachers not notice patterns that were building, they are trained to look for these things. they are supposed to report students that they feel are troubled. they have the right to search students rooms if they feel a threat is present. Did they do any of this. NO. they sat on there ass, even when he was killing people and did nothing. because they don't care.
Ultimately that is what is wrong with the world today. No one cares about anything or anyone but themselves. Until something tragic happens and all of a sudden there heart pours out to those victims until the novelty wears off and the news stops reporting the story. then its business as usual, care about one's self and nothing else.",9,1,"Despite the tragedy at VT, there should NOT be tighter gun control laws."

You can't possibly have tougher laws against murder, yet murder still occurs.
Criminals do not respect the law.
Why should a murderer with no respect for the law prohibiting murder be concerned with firearms law? How can we expect a criminal to respect firearms laws when a criminal, by definition, has no respect for the law in the first place?
Existing firearms restrictions did not stop the Virginia Tech murders. Why should we expect additional and more stringent firearms laws to alter that situation?
Even if there was a death penalty for posessing a firearm on the Virginia Tech campus, this particular murderer would have done just what he did. He killed himself in the end. He planned to die. Even the most severe penalty at our disposal would not have deterred him from murdering students.
However, had even one student in any of the areas the murders were committed (or attempted) the criminal may have been shot and disabled or killed.

We should ban knives just like Japan is looking at doing because of the high percentage of criminal homicides and suicides that are committed with knives.

There is a reason none of these massacres occur on military bases, police academies, or gun ranges. Criminals are looking for prey not opponents
The ONLY time these massacres have ever been stopped is by an armed citizens. The police have NEVER EVER stopped a single one from occurring. They arrive in time to collect the dead bodies. Only armed citizens at the scenes are capable of stopping violent crimes as they occur. As in the following cases. Please Google the names for the full story. Google will also help you verify each of the stats presented below.

Tracy Bridges & Mikael Gross stopped a mass murder at Appalachian School of Law, after lives were lost while they retrieved their guns from their cars, where they were required by policy to keep them.

*Guns are used 2. 5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime)
* Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime)
* As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,)
* Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606) (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,)
* Only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high." (George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards'?," Newsweek)

But in a speech delivered to the National Research Council, he said while he was once "a believer in the antigun' thesis," he has now moved "beyond even the skeptic position." Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University, a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate. "Armed Resistance to Crime" won Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award. This award is given for the book published that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology.

On the other hand, if you consider the time frame in which the constitution was written and factor in the world events at the time, what you see is a bunch of rebels who are fed up with corrupt and tyrannical governments (i.e., British government) who are attempting to build a new nation for themselves. Certainly they didn't think that they were mere citizens nor did they have illusions of grander thinking that they were a professional army (i.e., British Redcoats).
So they figured on a compromise, a "well organized militia" which individual states could raise in a short time frame in the event of an emergency. Sadly, this militia has now be recognized as the Armed Forces and is primarily the responsibility of the Federal (not State) government.
Now let's say that in another 100 or so years, we the people get upset with the way our country is being run by crooked politicians, dirty lobbyist, and the rich (a.k.a. the Haves). While the remaining majority (a.k.a. the Have-nots) decides it's time for another revolution. Somehow I don't think we rebels will win with stick and stones compared the assault weapons used by the military which is being controlled by the corrupt and tyrannical government.

And your claim about no gun regulation is false. I cannot go out and buy handgrenades, and any weapon I do buy requires a waiting period, registration, and possibile denial of the weapon.
You're throwing out the numbers but its the percentage that matters. If we double the population then we will statiscially double the murders. Murding 3 people is significant if there are only 10 people alive, but not if there are 3 million.

People aren't thinking about the alternative to legalized guns. Think, if one day every gun owning American's weapon was made illegal. Think up the uproar that would ensue, an uproar of armed civilians.
I like to compare this scenario loosely with the prohibition of alcohol, or maybe the theory behind legalizing major drugs to curb drug-related crimes.

2821,"gun control","Gun laws here in Australia were tightened considerably after a similar massacre` here to what happened at Virginia Tech, and have been tightened again a few times since. Gun owners here must belong to a club, be licensed for type of gun they own with new renewal and photo every year, belong to a gun club and have X amounts of sport shoots per year to maintain that license. Guns cannot be kept available for protection, but must be locked away separately from ammunition at all times, and having a license gives the police the right to search my home at will and random to make sure that is the case.
Being an American, I find this a bit intrusive, and hard to swallow, but there ya go, that's the law, and being a law abiding gun owner, I obey the laws of the land, no matter my opinion of them. There is no constitutional right to fall back on here.
Now for some facts:
Australia has become, per capita, number one in the world for burglary, number one in the world for car theft, and number 3 in the world for rapes. All crimes that could be potentially averted by even the thought that the victim might be able to protect themselves. There is a strong detterant to thinking "that woman might have a gun in her bag" or "if I break thru that window I might be met by the barrel of a shotgun". Australia also has one of the lowest police to citizen ratio's in the world, so, try though they might, there just aren't enough cops to go around.
Be all that as it may, my number one reason for opposing gun control is simply that I have never found a country or a government or a police system that I trust to be there each and every time I might be called upon to defend myself.",9,1,For.
2819,"gun control","Other than your second amendment guarantees and everything, Guns can be very useful tools when in the right hands.
For example. Suburban family, stay at home wife, with little kids, husband at work very often. Perfect Target right? An intruder comes in with the intent of rape/burglary/murder, etc... what's going to protect you? The Police? before or after the intruder unhooks the phone? Or maybe strangles your kids or you to death? Even without a gun, many people can simply physically overpower others. With a gun you have a sense of security in knowing that you may not be overpowered by a stronger, bigger individual. In this instance, the stay at home wife can defend herself with one simple handgun, effectively driving away the perpetraitor. Life saved? very likely.
Of course guns aren't always used for good, esp. in this country, but there are always good uses for them. Without guns, people will use bows. Without bows people will use knives. Without knives people will use anything. Heck anything can be deadly if enough force is put behind it. We can't go making everything illegal now should we?",9,1,For.
2819,"gun control","To keep them out of the wrong hands, we definately need to have stricter control over multiple areas
1) Stop it at its source: Importation. Hundreds of thousands of illegal weapons are imported to this country everyday. Many of these Semi- and Fully automatic, The U.S. particularly needs to step up efforts in checking and stopping the import of illegal items.
2) Keep legal weapons out of the wrong hands: Buying a gun should be much much harder and less readily available then they currently are. By putting people through rigorous background checks, drug-testing, and psychological background checks, we can much more easily keep guns from being in the wrong hands to begin with. They should not be able to sell a gun to anyone who doesn't have a gun liscense, and the requirements to get a gun license should be much much more strict.
3) Less readily available for sale: Local stores such as Wal-Marts and the like should not be allowed to sell weapons. Additionally There should be a mandatory 'cooling off' period for sale of any firearm in every state. Meaning that you can not just go into a store and buy a gun. You have to request the purchase of a gun atleast (at minimum) one week, before you actually receive the firearm.
4) Price Inflation: Inflating the price of not guns: but ammo will help deter a lot of crime. Currenty a 100ct. box of 9mm bullets costs $1.25 at your local Wal-Mart, much heftier taxes and costs will prevent gun use for the wrong means.
I'm not saying that there aren't flaws in the system, or that guns do more good than harm. But without them, believe me, we'd be much worse off. Sure most intruders can come in armed as well. But if guns were illegal to the general public, then all the criminals would still have weapons that they get off black market and underground trading, while your general public is more susceptible to crime now.

The United States Constitution, Second Amendment, and Tenth Amendment as a collective guarantee me, the person, the right to own and carry arms.

The U.S. government is not specifically granted the right to regulate arms, thus, that right is reserved to the State and the People. The State is prevented from infringing upon that right by the Second Amendment.
Any form of permit is an infringement of that right, since "permit" implies that the power granted by the permit is a privelege, not a right, and thus subject to revocation or denial. Thus permits are an infringement on a right.

407,"gun control","I am not 100% comfortable posting on this side of the debate because of the way the premise is framed. My belief, and I think it is backed up by the facts, is that if guns are totally banned, then crime increases. If guns are relatively easily available to citizens who are proven responsible enough to handle a weapon, free of a criminal history, and checked for a history of mental illness then all crime goes down. The catch is that if guns are too easy to get, even the criminals or those driven to crime by sudden passion or mental illness can easily obtain the weapons neccesary to cause mayhem. Even though I am a proponent of private ownership of guns, I am totally supportive of reasonable waiting periods to minimize the occurence of "crimes of passion".
Several states in the US have passed "right to carry" laws. These laws permit legal gun owners to carry a concealed weapon on their person at any time. In 2004, states with RTC laws, compared to other states, had lower violent crime rates on average. Total violent crime was lower by 21%, murder by 28%, robbery by 43%, and aggravated assault by 13%.9.

I have also often read about the low level of violent crime in Great Britain. A new study suggests the use of handguns in crime rose by 40% in the two years after a recent weapons ban was implemented. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/1440764.stm",9,1,"Gun control would greatly reduce crime in the United States."

Sure, hunters would be upset, but maybe going back to using the weapons of the original Americans (bow and arrow) would increase the challenge and reward of hunting.
Realistically, the first step should be tighter gun possession/purchasing laws. And crimes involving guns should have even greater consequences than they do now.

A gun in your home is 43 times more likely to kill you (suicide) or a family member than a criminal. Have I ever purchased a gun? No, I am educated and can comprehend that the dangers are not worth the reward. If you want to live in the Wild West move to a developing country like Mozambique or Somalia…
There are developing countries in which almost EVERY household has a gun and guess what, they still have extremely high rates of rape and murder. Yet, there are countries in which hardly anyone owns a gun and they have practically NO violent crime, their police don’t even need guns!
So, is it a coincidence that all the countries that have high gun ownership rates also have high violent crime rates? And that countries with low gun ownership rates also have the lowest violent crime rates….I don’t think so

The fact that even with police around people are still attacked and murdered every day really negates this argument.

Of you could manage to legislate firearms out of existance, then the real work would begin, and that is creating a society where people do not understand violence as a legitimate tool of influence. Part of the problem with many bans on weapons is that people tend to underestimate the commitment to violence that exists in their societies. Modern Zimbabwe is much more violent than the United States, yet you hear very little about shootings - it's mainly beating and dismemberments with machetes. What would you do there to stem the violence, ban bladed implements and trees?

When the Firearm Safety Act was passed which put massive restrictions on the ability of people to own the same tools as the government which up until its passage shortly after the turn of the century had been the case.
Furthermore, your claim "Just because you can't carry a pistol onto certain campuses or specified buildings doesn't mean you can't store a legally-purchased gun at home. So as I've proven, the individual right isn't being infringed--it's still there." makes no sense. Again you are infringing on an individuals right to carry that pistol when you say that they can not carry it any place that they wish to go. You bring up the example of campuses (I assume you refer to universities), what exactly is it that makes a normal sane American citizen, who chooses to carry a pistol when not on campus, suddenly make them turn into a psychotic murderer just because they pass over an imaginary line on the ground. How much sense does it make for a person to be considered law abiding on one side of the street and then a law breaker on the other just because of an object.

And on to machine guns, is it possible to live in a society where machine guns are able to be acquired by the general populous... yes it is because it is possible to own a fully automatic machine gun if one has the desire to do so. There is a ban on the import of fully automatic firearms into the US since the 1980's and they are no longer manufactured here at home any longer either. That does not mean that you can not purchase one if you want, the fact is that because only pre1984/1985 machine guns are the only ones on the market they are not sold lightly and cost upwards of $20,000. Since the law was enacted there has only been one reported case of a machine gun used in a crime, and it was not by a citizen, it was committed by a police officer with a department firearm.

2802,"gun control","The United States Constitution is very specific in its wording from the preamble, through the articles and the amendments. The Preamble opens with "We the People of the United States" and it is very clear that People refers to individual citizens. The word people throughout the constitution in the same context.
Amendment 10: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
The wording in amendment 10 is extremely clear. Any power not specifically granted to the U.S. is reserved for the States respectively, or to the people.
Amendment 2: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
The prefatory clause mentions that a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free State. This implies that the freedom of the State is of paramount importance and a well regulated militia will maintain the security of the State.
The operative clause uses the word people and not state or militia. The people (all citizens) make up the militia and those people have a right to both keep and bear arms. This clearly implies that the individual person has a right to own and carry arms. The operative clause does not mention the militia, nor does it mention the state. It specifically refers to the people.
Another key phrase in the operative clause is "shall not be infringed." This language is again, very precise.
From the Oxford Dictionary: Infringe: 1 violate (a law, agreement, etc.). 2 encroach on (a right or privilege). Oxford: Encroach: 1 (encroach on/upon) gradually intrude on (a person’s territory, rights, etc.). 2 advance gradually beyond expected or acceptable limits.
Thus the prefatory clause implies that for a State to secure its freedom a well regulated militia is necessary. The operative clause clearly states that the right of the people to own and carry arms shall not be gradually intruded on or violated.
Thus, the 2nd amendment implies that any law restricting specific types of firearms, inconveniencing the ownership of firearms (through sales or import restrictions, for example) or taxing firearms without representation is prohibited.
The 10th amendment clearly states that the State and the People are guaranteed all rights not granted the U.S. government. No right to restrict or regulate firearms is granted the U.S. government, thus such rights are reserved for the States and the People. Furthermore, the 2nd amendment guarantees the State security and the People the right to own and carry arms, and specifically grants the People immunity from infringement on that right.
Any form of arms regulation is a gradual encroachment, or infringement, of that right.
Thus, the second amendment "flat out" DOES pertain to the regulation of who can sell arms, who can buy arms, for what purpose arms can be used, and wehere arms can be carried.
The second amendment guarantees that the people have the right to own and carry firearms with no encroachment upon that right.
The tenth amendment further guarantees that since the U.S. government was not specifically granted the right to regulate firearms in any way, shape or form, that the right to regulate firearms is thus reserved to the State or the People. The second amendment protects the people from infringement to that right.
Thus, by viewing the Constitution of the United States in its entirety with both the second and tenth amendments, any regulation of firearms is unconstitutional.",9,1,"Agaist Gun control"
3453,"gun control","I can agree in concept the "regulation" is Constitutional.
The problem is when "regulation" is used as a means of "control".
Licensing sellers as other businesses is fine, but when you start adding requirements based on what is being sold, you are now limiting where those business can be and controlling the access. If you make arbitrary and capricious decisions on who can sell them, you have also now controlled and limited that. These are infringements on a persons chosen business.
Licensing buyers is an even greater form of control. Remember poll taxes? I think all will agree that when you start putting obstacles up to those trying to exercise a right, you are infringing on that right.
By it's very definition, "regulation" limits and controls what can and can't be done. These regulations, or limitations, encroach on others privacy (tracking purchase and possessions), choice (why is freedom of choice is only good when it comes to abortion?), as well as other things.
Not coincidentally, "To encroach on someone or something" is the most relevant definition of "Infringe".
Abortion is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution, yet a "right to privacy" issue in 14th Amendment has been stretched to the point of legitimizing the taking of a life as a private matter the government cannot restrict.
It would seem to be fair then that ownership of weapons would also have privacy protections and 4th and 14th Amendment protections regarding property and effects should afford protections to own firearms as well.
Thankfully, we don't need such in depth interpretation and extrapolation to stretch these Amendments to provide the protections we seek, instead we were provided with a simple, direct, and clearly worded protection in the 2nd Amendment - "The right of the PEOPLE to keep and bear arms, shall NOT BE INFRINGED".",9,1,"Agaist Gun control"

We all own computers, and as such have equal capabilities to become hackers just as we have of using this tool for completely peaceful purposes. Likewise I would assume that all of us own matches or lighters, does this make us more inclined to become an arsonist? No. Why is it that individuals generally equate guns with evil convicts who are out to rape and murder?
I would not disagree that we should be more concerned with our daily lives than the unlikely event that there is a terrorist attack, but this begs two questions; would being prepared for one not help with being prepared for the other, and would gun control truly help prevent someone from committing a crime or does it merely remove one possible means of defense from a potential victim?

The Mayor himself stated that he did not expect it to be effective, but wanted it to start a dialog. Another example of silly laws; in Chico CA it is illegal to have a nuclear weapon within city limits, furthermore, there is a $500 fine for detonating a nuclear weapon within city limits.

As Winston Churchill said, "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, after they've exhausted every alternative" (or something to that effect), it seems the Brits weren't exclusive from that quote either.
Interestingly enough, it was the Conservative policy of throwing Armed Forces, Special Forces and empowering armed Loyalists that turned the Irish issue into the bloodiest terrorism conflict that Great Britain has ever seen.

3640,"gun control","Actually, I just looked it up and it seems I was mistaken, guns do statistically decrease sucsessful crimes and increase safety. There are still many people who injure themselves and loved ones with firearms, but overall the effect seems to be positive. However that doesn't change my view a whole lot (it does remove a small piece of ignorance from my brain, so i thank you for that). There should definitely be laws controlling gun ownership.
"I don't think you realize your own internal conflict on this issue 011235813, you claim that you are "not in favor of gun banning laws," but within the very same paragraph you go on to state that "we need stricter laws about... which types of weapons should be allowed." Now I have no idea how you can reconcile these two completely contradictory statements. Because if you say that some types of firearms should not be allowed then you ARE in favor of laws which ban guns. There just isn't any way around it. "
Now that I read that again I realize it sounds very hypocritical, let me clarify. I think that guns in general should not be banned. If you want a gun for self defense reasons or hunting or anything along those lines, than it is your right. I do think there should be laws about the storage of these weapons. Locked up hunting weapons, self defense weapons, out of reach of children etc. Also some guns should be banned. There is absolutely no reason a civilian would need an AK or sniper rifle or any weapon designed solely for the purpose of military operation.

Laws regulating the storage of firearms are all but impossible to enforce unless we adopt a police state. Also, how would a firearm which is owned for self defense be able to fulfill its intended role if it is locked in a safe? Any laws controlling gun ownership is by definition unconstitutional.
I am a fervent supporter of firearm education for all, this way negligent discharges can be mitigated. Proper training on the use of these tools is very important to ensure safety for all.
I disagree with your statement that "there is no reason a civilian would need an AK or sniper rifle," the AK that you are undoubtedly thinking of is the legal semi-automatic version of the Kalashnikov. These are no different in their functionality than is the hunting rifle that you see no problem allowing. Currently the United States Army uses rifles based off of hunting rifles to fulfill sniper requirements.
It all boils down to the user and not the tool. A gun is an inanimate object that can no more be a killing machine than a spoon without the person holding it in their hands. Obviously this argument does not take into account Terminator. ;-)",9,1,"No - it is the police who failed here, not 'gun control laws'"
3640,"gun control",""Also, how would a firearm which is owned for self defense be able to fulfill its intended role if it is locked in a safe?"
I did not say to lock self defense firearms in a safe. I just think they should be kept out of reach of children, and the children should be properly educated about the firearms and their hazards.
It is illegal to use military weapons for hunting, if the AK to which you referred was redesigned as a hunting rifle, than that isn't the point. There is no reason to own any sort of gun with no purpose but to harm other people.
"Currently the United States Army uses rifles based off of hunting rifles to fulfill sniper requirements."
That's all well and good, but it doesn't mean we should take the actual sniper rifles and go hunting. I'm fairly sure that that would be illegal. Again a hunting rifle is a different weapon than a sniper rifle, whether or not one is based on the other is irrelevant.
"Any laws controlling gun ownership is by definition unconstitutional."
I think that this is definitely debatable. The second amendment give Americans the "Right to Bear Arms," I agree, hunting rifles, shotguns, and self defense weaponry is a right. However, sub-machine guns, machine guns, sniper rifles, etc. serve no purpose other than killing and/or injuring people. Why would anyone need to own one? There is no good reason besides endangering the lives of others, which I hope we can both agree is not okay.",9,1,"No - it is the police who failed here, not 'gun control laws'"

Actually, the primary US Marine Corp. sniper rifle was based off of the Remington 700 bolt action rifle, but contains many custom and after market parts. For more info: http://tech.military.com/equipment/view/89052/m40a1-sniper-rifle.html
"Your final comment: It is absolutely debatable, or else we wouldn't be talking about it. when you turn machine guns and other firearms into objects that have "no purpose other than killing" you are inviting all firearms to be included in that category."

What a totally absurd misleading statement, with absolutely no basis in fact. I posted the below on another debate, but it applies here. Sorry for its length. It is as concise as I could get it
Guns are tools of protection and self defense. "Firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives." Why would anyone tale away the one thing that gives the peace loving law abiding an advantage over or at least equal footing to the evil and violent? No peace loving does not have to mean voluntary victim.
If your assumptions are right than why does Washington DC which has a virtual ban on all guns consistently have the highest murder rate in the nation? While Vermont the safest state in the Union has no gun control laws permitting any adult to purchase any gun they wish and carry it as they wish without a permit license or waiting period. In study after study the evidence shows that states with the least restrictive laws regarding the ownership and carry of guns by law abiding citizens are the safest. Many researchers no most researchers who study guns and their effects on society like Lott and Kleck were pro gun control advocates prior to their research. After their studies did a complete 180. Coming around to support even advocating law abiding citizens civic duty to carry a gun.
There are in fact many studies of countries that have banned gun completely that do show that after a dramatic increase in gun violence immediately following the gun bans. There is a significant drop in gun violence, after a few years. There have been claims that in countries that ban guns, there is a marked drop in gun violence. Recently those studies have been exposed as being inaccurate and distorted to support the gun bans. But lets accept that they are true. That gun bans do reduce gun violence. I can accept that as fact. But the statement is misleading because violent crime, rape, armed robbery, murder, and assault with a deadly weapon increased dramatically. Even double and still rising. In England teachers, even students are required to have bullet proof vests actually knife resistant vest. Because knife and sword attacks are now so common. In fact England has recently outlawed Samurai swords to go along with their gun ban. Kitchen knives and scissors are sure to follow suit shortly.
FBI surveys reveal convicted criminals stating that they avoid victims that they think may be armed. Maybe that is why most criminals support gun control. Every state that has passed laws permitting concealed carry has seen dramatic drops in violent crime. Maybe we don't need studies maybe some common sense will work. Lets look at some facts I think we can all agree on.
1) Criminals do not obey the law. That is why they are criminals
2) Criminals as a whole are lazy. Maybe another reason they are criminals, demanding prosperity without effort.
3) So it follows that criminals seek out victims / prey not opponents. Armed citizens are opponents.
4) It is for that reason that most all mass murders occur in so called "Gun Free Zones". Only the criminals have guns in those areas
4) Less restrictive gun control means more law abiding citizens could be armed. Which means what to the criminal?
I agree this is 2009 we should be far more evolved as a society. We should not have to need to defend ourselves from violent predators. Personally I run from fights and avoid bad areas and do all I can to avoid being a victim. Most gun owners I know do. I do not like packing a two pound pice of steel on my hip everywhere I go. I would have preferred to go on a cruise with my beautiful loving wife rather than spend the money on training courses guns and ammunition. God knows she deserves it. Heck I'd rather go on a cruise instead of paying for insurance too. But she deserves to be safe even more. Like my insurance, seat belts, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors I hope I never ever have to use my gun. There is a good chance I won't but I would much rather have it and never need it than need it and not have it. My niece did not think she needed one. She was right she didn't until the night she was dragged into a van where they kept her for four days and nights. A once stunningly beautiful young lady now covered with scars from knife wounds and cigar burns inside and outside of her body. The scars in her soul will never heal. She will never be the mommy she so wanted to be. She loved children so much that is where she was that night, working with under privileged kids. To this day she regrets not taking me up on my offer to a gun and training sooner. Today, she knows that the woman laying in the ally raped and strangled to death with her won panties is NOT morally superior to the woman explaining to the police why the rapist has two holes in his chest is. No that could never happen to you, it could not happen to her either. I'll close with some facts you can easily verify with a google search. Its is how I found them. Unlike the mass murders we have all read so much about armed citizens have managed to do what the police have never been able to do stop many mass murders.
February 12, 2007, In Ogden Utah: Kenneth K. Hammond carrying a concealed weapon stopped a massacre at the Trolley Square Mall in Utah
December 11, 2007, In Colorado Springs Colorado: After killing two people at a mission training school the killer drove 65 miles killing two more people in the parking lot before entering New Life Church carrying a rifle, two pistols and a backpack holding more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. intent on killing all 1,000 members inside the church. Which he would have done had Jeanne Assam not been there with her legally carried handgun. Jeanne Assam a member of the congregation (not a security guard as the media erroneously reported) stopped the killer before he could begin his massacre
January 16, 2002, In Grundy, Virginia: Tracy Bridges & Mikael Gross stopped a mass murder at Appalachian School of Law, after lives were lost while they retrieved their guns from their cars, where they were required by policy to keep them. ( If college students legally licensed to carry concealed weapons been able to carry gun on school property no innocents would have died)
1998, In Edinboro, Pennsylvania: Restaurant's owner, James Strand stopped a killers rampage in Edinboro, Pennsylvania saving the lives of 240 students at a school dance a full eleven minutes before police arrived. One teacher John Gillette, 48, was killed
October 1997, In Pearl City Mississippi: Principal Joel Myrick stopped a slaughter at Pearl High School with his .45 after lives were lost while he retrieved his .45 from his car, where it was required by law to be kept. (Had legally licensed school principles and teachers been able to carry his gun on school property none would have died)
Obviously there is a pattern. Only those places that had an legally armed citizen were able to stop the rampaging mad men. The police were unable to stop a single killing not one. Nor is it reasonable to expect them to. They will only arrive in time to pick up the bodies. Isn't it about time to start looking at what works what saves lives? Stop creating law and policy based on what feels good and base our decisions on facts. On what works to save human lives
*Guns are used 2. 5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime)
* Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime)
* Anti-gun Clinton researchers in a effort to discredit that study claimed that firearms used in self defense saved ONLY 1. 5 million lives a year. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are only 1. 5 million cases of self-defense with a firearm every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of "Guns in America" a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig
* As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,)
* Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606) (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,)
* Only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high." (George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards'?," Newsweek)
* Concealed Weapon Permit holders are the single most law abiding segment of the population. More law abiding than doctors, judges, law enforcement and ministers (From FBI crimes statistics)
As I have said in a perfect world this would not need to be a topic of conversation, there would be no rage hate greed and selfishness. Ideally we could keep guns away from criminals. Than there would be no need for guns. But this is not a perfect world and the laws based upon ideals has only managed to take guns away from the rational and law abiding. Causing all of us to be out gunned unarmed and defenseless in the face of evil. Maybe it is time to make laws based on the realities of 2009 and support the rights of law abiding citizens to defend themselves. Maybe it is time to do something we know works. Maybe it is time to take some personal responsibility and accountability for our won safety and well being. Stop demanding that the state and the police do the impossible.

2. By disarming police and law abiding citizens the only people left to obtain guns are criminals who are the ones committing violent crimes anyway. The only result is that the rate of gun related self defense cases would drop to zero while the rate of gun related crimes would stay exactly the same (if not increase).
3. Your logic falls apart on this point. If the 2nd amendment is outdated and therefore irrelevant in today's society, then the checks and balances (which were established at about the same time) are also outdated. There can be (and some would suggest already is) tyrannical rule in the United States. Our government protects itself from becoming too powerful but not any organization outside of it.

Millions of Americans armed to the teeth or any invading military force from any country or countries? My money is on American citizens ever time. We can see how easily a committed, armed group of pissed of citizens can defend against a stronger invading military force by looking at Afghanistan throughout history.
In conclusion there are no good points listed that would convince me that "no one should own a gun, neither the citizens nor the police."

As I've stated, a government becomes oppressive when it holds rights the citizens themselves do not have. By prohibiting civilian ownership of guns, but not military ownership, you are already paving way for further oppression in other aspects of civil liberty.
However, I should probably point out that a government can also become oppressive when it legislates restrictions on individuals that either do not DIRECTLY infringe upon the rights of others, or DIRECTLY diminishes the government's ability to defend civil liberties.
Now I'm sure your counterargument would be that gun ownership infringes upon people's right to safety. However, the problem with this assertion is that (forgive me for resorting to the use of a cliche) its not guns that kill people, its people who kill people. Guns are merely a medium through which such acts are committed. In the same way, duck tape can be used to silence someone, thus infringing upon their right to free speech. This does not mean that firearms should be outlawed. Also, in order to outlaw guns under that rationale, logically you would have to outlaw ANYTHING that can be used to kill someone, which is a practical impossibility.
In terms of American bravado, I'd first like to point out that I am the last person on Earth to support America's contemptible foreign policy. In fact, I'm furious with President Obama for not opening up a trial for Bush Administration officials for war crimes.

Could this - by any chance - be a HUNTING thing? Not the 'providing for the survival of the family' type, but a modern version where where emasculated men try to pretend they aren't by taking big guns and shooting at animals raised in semi-captivity, which are then 'released' and, bewildered, these are 'valiantly slayed', thus proving once and for all that those who bravely hid and waited for them to be flushed into their sights are, somehow, 'REAL men'?

With one exception: the slavery against Americans thing....
It makes me very, very angry when people who are living in America today are having it thrown into their faces that slavery was an undeniable part of their past. Do you REALLY think that people like Jonjax and Sandifromlargo or Lonewolf or Antado deserve to be berated, personally, because of what happened long before they were born? The aftereffects of which they have worked to set right, as much as possible?
If anything, being aware of the past injustices like 'slavery' makes modern Americans more willing to stand up for the downtrodden and unfortunate people of the world today! American society today is more egalitarian than any other I have had the pleasure of experiencing.
Which nation contributes - per capita - MOST to help victims of natural disasters around the world? Americans do. Regardless of race or religion of the victims.
And while Americans have openly debated the slavery in their past, most European nations - which have ALSO participated in slave trade, many of them to at least as great a degree as America had - have still failed to face their past misdeeds in this!

I understand your belief that guns ensure our protection, but where that is true it is as well so that they endanger it, not unlike the double-edged sword. The liberal standpoint is thusly that the lack guns is the lack of threat. These views are both equally reasonable. However, banning firearms can and may cause an increase in organized crime, as was the case in the prohibition, so that is not a proper action. To do nothing about the matter is equally as damaging.

gwrocks9, you're saying that it is better for children to have handguns so they could shoot "bad" people in the leg. This depends on what the children considers "bad".
Children, not having the same decision making and temper controlling skills as adults, may murder someone because of something very small, such as getting on his nerves, or calling him something bad.
This not only applies to children, but some adults as well. Unfortunately, not all adults understand what is morally right and wrong, so they may hurt/ kill people that didn't do anything wrong.
The most logical solution to this problem is for the government to give tests to its citizens to test their morals and their decision making skills.

2- Regardless of the trafficking issue, let’s say that the us government is able to control that, this doesn’t mean that the problem is solved, many crimes are committed with legally purchased weapons, whether but the owner who just cracks and start shooting people someday, or the gun is stolen then sold in the black market to criminals, they can’t easily erase the serial number and then it’s simply the same as a smuggled gun.

More or less, the statement that "when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will own guns" is true. It is arguably true that a ban on guns might act as a deterrent to the more cowardly criminals; however, the majority of criminals who use firearms do so on a fairly regular basis, which means that strict anti-firearm legislation, rather than preventing the abuse or illegal distribution of firearms, will only force criminals to become more resourceful in order to obtain the tools of their trade. The same may be said for prohibition and the War on Drugs, both of which have proven extremely ineffective. Interestingly, both of these cases also demonstrated a significant increase in related crime. In the case of prohibition, organized crime centered mostly around the protection of speakeasies and the clandestine proliferation of alcohol--in other words, bootlegging. With the War on Drugs, we can see a similar problem with the amount of sheer power that drug cartels have gained since the United States' decision to crack down on illicit substances. Given these two historical cases concerning the lack of efficacy of legal prohibitions, it seems counterproductive to reducing gun-related and gun-aided crimes to ban firearms entirely.
This whole argument, of course, says nothing of the basic argument that we have a fundamental right, guaranteed by the Constitution and repeatedly upheld by the Supreme Court, to maintain a stock of firearms for the sake of personal security.
Now, to the credit of my anti-gun friends on the other side, I also don't agree with gun-loving conservatives who claim that our ability to own guns shouldn't be infringed upon in any way, shape, or form. There are two reasons for this:
1. Conservatives are notoriously hypocritical regarding ownership of weapons. Their creed, famously repeated, is that guns don't kill people--people kill people; yet when it comes to the subject of other countries owning weapons--nuclear weapons, especially--conservative advocates are outraged by the very suggestion that we allow them to develop such technologies.
2. Still, just as I believe that nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran or North Korea would be quite a mistake, so too would I object to the ownership of massive assault rifles, machine guns, large ordinance, etc. by ordinary civilians. If the reason for upholding gun rights is to preserve the average American's ability to provide for his own defense, we can hardly say that it is necessary for him to own firepower employed well beyond the range of home security.
Consequently, we can conclude that, though the pro-gun position is clearly the more rational, it is at the same time in our best interests to formulate a set of heavy regulations to ensure that the firearms available to average Americans don't extend very far beyond the range of handguns and hunting rifles. In other words: preserve rights, but only within reason.",9,1,Pro-Guns
