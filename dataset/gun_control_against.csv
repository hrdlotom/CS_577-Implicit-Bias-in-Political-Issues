Obviously, there are those individuals who are dangerous (criminals) and thus should be denied access. However, that doesn't mean that all people should not be allow to have firearms. I also don't believe that just because the Constitution says we should have guns, we should. The Constitution is a changing document, and all policies are not written in stone. So why should guns be allowed? The answer is two fold:Recreation and Protection. Hunting is still an enormously popular sport, and people should have the ability to defend themselves if the need arises.";9;0;3;"Citizens should have the right to own guns"

The harder it is to obtain a gun, the more common that untraceable, illegally obtained guns will be. There is no way to avoid that particular eventuality. I would love to see a heavily enforced registration system, where a gun could be easily obtained, but could be identified and traced back to the registered owner. Add a little responsibility to gun ownership, in a way. I know there are some privacy concerns with a giant police Rolodex of gun owners, but privacy invasion is a different subject entirely. Guns are a legitimate form of recreation and protection. I once heard it described to me in a way that made wonderful sense, every kid learns stop drop and roll, but no one has seriously considered teaching gun safety in school. What is more likely: a child catching fire spontaneously in a situation where rolling around is an option, or encountering a poorly hidden gun as a child?

The international weighted murder rate is about .1 per thousand, with that source listing our murder rate at .0428 per thousand. This puts us at #24 on the list of 62. We do have murder rates ten times that of only two nations- Saudi Arabia and Qatar. I sort of attribute that to their stricter penal code, though. Interestingly, civilized nations like the United Kingdom, Finland, Denmark, and New Zealand outpace us in crime.

For example, my neighbor across the street packs an M-16, and he makes our street the safest in town. The main purpose for civilians owning guns, however, is not to overthrow a coup, but in self defense.

The guy had the most common gun, and he obtained it legally. It wasn't too easy to get, and it wasn't the cause of the tragedy. He was. He could have bought them illegally if he wanted to. He gave two forms of ID, and a credit card, went through a background check, and waited to get the gun, like everyone else. I would ask what you would suggest on top of that? Putting up collateral like your house in the event that you kill someone...which, your house will already be taken away if you did kill someone, and were convicted. But if you were going to commit suicide afterwards and you're obviously crazy, what d you care? And if you're willing to kill 31 people, you're also willing to get a gun illegally. There is no test for "crazy", so you just never know. So what do you suggest? Making guns illegal? That would work about as good as prohibition did. The FACT is, senseless violence, and terrorism is easy, and any reaction to it is just fluff. Terrorist act on airplane = beef up airport security with guards. Guy shoots people on campus = every campus now needs a swat team. The truth of the matter is anyone can kill any number of people at anytime. All it takes is the right mindset to do it. Guards in an airport stops people from getting on planes, but killing hundreds of people in an airport would make the same impact, and would be just as easy. And in closing..."you could say the same for murder: even though we have a law against it, people still do it. However, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a law against murder.

2804;"gun control";"Ah but here's the rub about the "right to bear arms", it was written in a time where the people may have the "need" to overthrow "corrupt and tyrannical" rulers and governments. Just look at the Declaration of Independence, the wording and language used is one that justifies the how the constitution came to be. Why is it that for our founding fathers of this nation, the right to speech ranks as number one, followed by the "right to bear arms"? Now granted, an argument could be made that the 2nd amendment guarantees the "right to bear arms" for a "well regulated militia" and not necessarily to citizens. Granted that's the a different argument about what constitutes a well regulated militia (e.g., is a well regulated militia an standing army or merely citizens). Somehow I don't believe that the founding fathers would "limit" which "arms" could be used. It would be rather stupid and silly for an uprising to use sticks and stones against a tyrannical army equipped with fully automatic assault rifles. As for weapons of mass destruction, a pistol is hardly a WMD. Heck even assault rifles aren't WMD. You would have to go to something really nasty (e.g.., nukes, dirty bombs, lots of explosives, chemical bombs in enclosed spaces, and biological weapons). All of which are pretty hard to manufacture without someone noticing with the exception of the lots of explosives (i.e., Oklahoma City Bombing). Now for the last point, how does one use a weapon against the U.S. Government and not on a civilian? Have we recently decided to draft non-citizens to serve in our armies? That argument of only being able to use weapons (e.g., guns) on the U.S. Government but not civilians is like my army buddy's policy of using a .50 caliber weapon to shoot the "equipment" of enemy soldiers. FYI, a .50 caliber weapon doesn't need to hit you to inflict bodily damage. Next a .50 caliber weapon is restricted to anti-armor weapons (e.g., weapons to be used against tanks) and it is against the Geneva Convictions to use a anti-armor weapon on people.";9;1;3;"Despite the tragedy at VT, there should NOT be tighter gun control laws."

Have a look, bud: ****** Media Ignore Fact That Gun Owners Stopped Law School Shooter By Phil Brennan NewsMax.com 2-2-2 Two of the three Virginia law students who overpowered a gunman in a fatal school shooting were armed and used their weapons to disarm the shooter. Yet of the 280 stories written about the shooting, a mere four mentioned the fact that the heroic students were armed and used their guns to halt the rampage. That's according to Dr. John Lott, a resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute and the author of the widely acclaimed book "More Guns, Less Crime." Writing in Friday's edition of the New York Post, Lott reported on last week's shooting at Appalachian School of Law. Nigerian student Peter Odighizuwa is accused of killing the dean, L. Anthony Sutin, 42 - a former acting assistant U.S. attorney general and campaign worker for Bill Clinton - professor Thomas Blackwell, 41, and student Angela Denise Dales, 33. Noting that the rampage was widely covered in the world's media, Lott wrote: "As usual, there were calls for more gun control. "Yet in this age of 'gun-free school zones,' the vast majority of news reports ignored the fact that the attack was stopped by two students who had guns in their cars. The quick response by two of the students, Mikael Gross, 34, and Tracy Bridges, 25, undoubtedly saved multiple lives," Lott reported. According to Lott: Having just returned from lunch, Gross was outside the law school building when Odighizuwa began shooting. Bridges was inside, waiting for class to start. When the sound of shooting erupted, panic ensued. "People were running everywhere. They were jumping behind cars, running out in front of traffic, trying to get away," Gross said. Instead of joining in the chaos, Gross and Bridges ran to their cars and got their guns. Joined by an unarmed Ted Besen, an ex-Marine and police officer, the three men approached the shooter from different sides. "I aimed my gun at him, and Peter tossed his gun down," Bridges recalled. "Ted approached Peter, and Peter hit Ted in the jaw. Ted pushed him back, and we all jumped on." Wrote Lott: "What is so remarkable is that out of 280 separate news stories (from a computerized Nexis-Lexis search) in the week after the event, just four stories mentioned that the students who stopped the attack had guns. "Only two local newspapers (the Richmond Times-Dispatch and the Charlotte Observer) mentioned that the students actually pointed their guns at the attacker." Lott cited the liberal, anti-gun Washington Post, which reported that the heroes had simply "helped subdue" the killer. The leftist, anti-gun New York Times, not surprisingly, noted only that the attacker was "tackled by fellow students." "Most in the media who discussed how the attack was stopped said: 'students overpowered a gunman,' 'students ended the rampage by tackling him,' 'the gunman was tackled by four male students before being arrested,' or 'Students ended the rampage by confronting and then tackling the gunman, who dropped his weapon.'" Such selective reporting is not unusual, Lott noted. "In the other public school shootings where citizens with guns have stopped attacks, rarely do more than 1 percent of the news stories mention that citizens with guns stopped the attacks." Wall of Silence Lott cited research showing there are 2 million defensive gun uses each year. "After all, if these events were really happening, wouldn't we hear about them on the news? But when was the last time you saw a story on the national evening news (or even the local news) about a citizen using his gun to stop a crime?" Such "misreporting actually endangers people's lives," Lott concluded. "By selectively reporting the news and turning a defensive gun use story into one where students merely 'overpowered a gunman' the media gives misleading impressions of what works when people are confronted by violence. "Research consistently shows that having a gun is the safest way to respond to any type of criminal attack, especially these multiple victim shootings." ****** "Waters points out that while a school shooting warrants national coverage, a woman who shoots and kills a serial rapist is only local news. (He aptly points out that in one school shooting, where the principal apprehended the shooter, he did so only because he, too, had a gun - a fact conveniently left out by most of the press.) He also notes that, though there are a few well-publicized shooting at schools each year, at least 700,000 times and perhaps over two million times a year, average American citizens, like you and like me, use a firearm to protect themselves, their families, friends, and sometimes complete strangers from criminal predators. At times the trigger is pulled, but more often the mere showing of a gun is enough to run the hoodlum off.

Yet statistically it has been proven that states that have concealed carry laws show a marked reduction in violent crime. The shooter at VT stood out in the open, unafraid of retribution, because he was the only person with a gun. He picked his victims and killed them. HE KILLED THEM, not the gun. The laws forbidding guns on campus did nothing to help the victims. The "Trained profesionals" were nowhere to be found to protect the victims. People who go through the vetting process to have a concealed carry permit are trained on how and when to use the gun. They do not seak out the opportunity! They would rather avoid it. You have insurance on your car. Do you actively go out looking to have an accident? Of course not, unless you are unstable. But wait, that would put you in the same class as the shooter, we better start outlawing cars as well. Can you see the point I am trying to make? The shooter at VT was not afraid of being shot at, he KNEW he was safe. HE was breaking the law with the intent in taking life and he KNEW he was safe.

756;"gun control";"These laws are already in place. The problem is not the laws the problem is the people that own the guns. We need to look closer at what causes these people to do these things. Why did this one kid that came from a well off family suddenly decide that he was going to walk through his school shooting people. Why did those students in the other schools over the years suddenly decide that they needed to walk through the school with there daddy's guns and start shooting people. We have never looked into why these people are doing these violent acts. we simply start pointing fingers and blaming TV, Video Games and Movies. We never truly find the cause, we never look at the family structure or the environment that they lived in or the people that they hung around. We simply take the word of the family "He was a good kid". Did these parents even know what there children were doing, obviously not. If they had played an active role in there life then they would have stopped this before it even started. The excuse that "We were giving him his space" will not work. The guy at V-Tech I considered to be an adult. He should have known better. So now we are looking at why he went off his rocker. Why did the teachers not notice patterns that were building, they are trained to look for these things. they are supposed to report students that they feel are troubled. they have the right to search students rooms if they feel a threat is present. Did they do any of this. NO. they sat on there ass, even when he was killing people and did nothing. because they don't care. Ultimately that is what is wrong with the world today. No one cares about anything or anyone but themselves.

You can't possibly have tougher laws against murder, yet murder still occurs. Criminals do not respect the law. Why should a murderer with no respect for the law prohibiting murder be concerned with firearms law? How can we expect a criminal to respect firearms laws when a criminal, by definition, has no respect for the law in the first place? Existing firearms restrictions did not stop the Virginia Tech murders. Why should we expect additional and more stringent firearms laws to alter that situation? Even if there was a death penalty for posessing a firearm on the Virginia Tech campus, this particular murderer would have done just what he did. He killed himself in the end. He planned to die. Even the most severe penalty at our disposal would not have deterred him from murdering students. However, had even one student in any of the areas the murders were committed (or attempted) the criminal may have been shot and disabled or killed.

Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker.

Dr. Kleck is a professor in the school of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State University, a member of the ACLU, Amnesty International USA, and Common Cause. He is not and has never been a member of or contributor to any advocacy group on either side of the gun control debate. "Armed Resistance to Crime" won Dr. Kleck the prestigious American Society of Criminology Michael J. Hindelang award. This award is given for the book published that makes the most outstanding contribution to criminology. Only armed citizens will ever be able to stop these slaughters. How many more must die before we end these defense free zones that only protect the criminal?";9;1;3;"Despite the tragedy at VT, there should NOT be tighter gun control laws."

If you mean a standing army, then yes this so called constitutional right is strictly to protect the military from ever losing the ability to "bear arms". On the other hand, if you consider the time frame in which the constitution was written and factor in the world events at the time, what you see is a bunch of rebels who are fed up with corrupt and tyrannical governments (i.e., British government) who are attempting to build a new nation for themselves. Certainly they didn't think that they were mere citizens nor did they have illusions of grander thinking that they were a professional army (i.e., British Redcoats). So they figured on a compromise, a "well organized militia" which individual states could raise in a short time frame in the event of an emergency. Sadly, this militia has now be recognized as the Armed Forces and is primarily the responsibility of the Federal (not State) government. Now let's say that in another 100 or so years, we the people get upset with the way our country is being run by crooked politicians, dirty lobbyist, and the rich (a.k.a. the Haves). While the remaining majority (a.k.a. the Have-nots) decides it's time for another revolution. Somehow I don't think we rebels will win with stick and stones compared the assault weapons used by the military which is being controlled by the corrupt and tyrannical government.

People aren't thinking about the alternative to legalized guns. Think, if one day every gun owning American's weapon was made illegal. Think up the uproar that would ensue, an uproar of armed civilians. I like to compare this scenario loosely with the prohibition of alcohol, or maybe the theory behind legalizing major drugs to curb drug-related crimes.

2821;"gun control";"Gun laws here in Australia were tightened considerably after a similar massacre` here to what happened at Virginia Tech, and have been tightened again a few times since. Gun owners here must belong to a club, be licensed for type of gun they own with new renewal and photo every year, belong to a gun club and have X amounts of sport shoots per year to maintain that license. Guns cannot be kept available for protection, but must be locked away separately from ammunition at all times, and having a license gives the police the right to search my home at will and random to make sure that is the case. Being an American, I find this a bit intrusive, and hard to swallow, but there ya go, that's the law, and being a law abiding gun owner, I obey the laws of the land, no matter my opinion of them. There is no constitutional right to fall back on here. Now for some facts: Australia has become, per capita, number one in the world for burglary, number one in the world for car theft, and number 3 in the world for rapes. All crimes that could be potentially averted by even the thought that the victim might be able to protect themselves. There is a strong detterant to thinking "that woman might have a gun in her bag" or "if I break thru that window I might be met by the barrel of a shotgun". Australia also has one of the lowest police to citizen ratio's in the world, so, try though they might, there just aren't enough cops to go around.

Or maybe strangles your kids or you to death? Even without a gun, many people can simply physically overpower others. With a gun you have a sense of security in knowing that you may not be overpowered by a stronger, bigger individual. In this instance, the stay at home wife can defend herself with one simple handgun, effectively driving away the perpetraitor. Life saved? very likely. Of course guns aren't always used for good, esp. in this country, but there are always good uses for them. Without guns, people will use bows. Without bows people will use knives.

2819;"gun control";"To keep them out of the wrong hands, we definately need to have stricter control over multiple areas 1) Stop it at its source: Importation. Hundreds of thousands of illegal weapons are imported to this country everyday. Many of these Semi- and Fully automatic, The U.S. particularly needs to step up efforts in checking and stopping the import of illegal items. 2) Keep legal weapons out of the wrong hands: Buying a gun should be much much harder and less readily available then they currently are. By putting people through rigorous background checks, drug-testing, and psychological background checks, we can much more easily keep guns from being in the wrong hands to begin with. They should not be able to sell a gun to anyone who doesn't have a gun liscense, and the requirements to get a gun license should be much much more strict. 3) Less readily available for sale: Local stores such as Wal-Marts and the like should not be allowed to sell weapons. Additionally There should be a mandatory 'cooling off' period for sale of any firearm in every state. Meaning that you can not just go into a store and buy a gun. You have to request the purchase of a gun atleast (at minimum) one week, before you actually receive the firearm. 4) Price Inflation: Inflating the price of not guns: but ammo will help deter a lot of crime. Currenty a 100ct. box of 9mm bullets costs $1.25 at your local Wal-Mart, much heftier taxes and costs will prevent gun use for the wrong means. I'm not saying that there aren't flaws in the system, or that guns do more good than harm. But without them, believe me, we'd be much worse off. Sure most intruders can come in armed as well. But if guns were illegal to the general public, then all the criminals would still have weapons that they get off black market and underground trading, while your general public is more susceptible to crime now.

The U.S. government is not specifically granted the right to regulate arms, thus, that right is reserved to the State and the People. The State is prevented from infringing upon that right by the Second Amendment. Any form of permit is an infringement of that right, since "permit" implies that the power granted by the permit is a privelege, not a right, and thus subject to revocation or denial.

So, despite the gun control law, it didn't prevent the tragedy. Is the answer tougher gun control laws? In Canada, every gun in the country must be registered. This would be in direct violation of the US Constitution. However, a variety of Canadian officials, including the chief of the second-largest police force in the country, have gone on record as saying it is useless. Why? Because criminals use illegal weapons. If people want guns, they will buy guns. If they can't purchase them legally, they will be smuggled in.

While Vermont the safest state in the Union has no gun control laws permitting any adult to purchase any gun they wish and carry it as they wish without a permit license or waiting period. In study after study the evidence shows that states with the least restrictive laws regarding the ownership and carry of guns by law abiding citizens are the safest. Many researchers no most researchers who study guns and their effects on society like Lott and Kleck were pro gun control advocates prior to their research. After their studies did a complete 180. Coming around to support even advocating law abiding citizens civic duty to carry a gun. There are in fact many studies of countries that have banned gun completely that do show that after a dramatic increase in gun violence immediately following the gun bans. There is a significant drop in gun violence, after a few years. It is a fact in ALL countries that ban guns, there is a marked drop in gun violence. Recently those studies have been exposed as being inaccurate and distorted to support the gun bans. But lets accept that they are true. That gun bans do reduce gun violence. I can accept that as fact. But the statement is misleading because violent crime, rape, armed robbery, murder, and assault with a deadly weapon increased dramatically. Even double and still rising. In England teachers, even students are required to have bullet proof vests actually knife resistant vest. Because knife and sword attacks are now so common. In fact England has recently outlawed Samurai swords to go along with their gun ban. Kitchen knives and scissors are sure to follow suit shortly. FBI surveys reveal convicted criminals stating that they avoid victims that they think may be armed. Maybe that is why most criminals support gun control. Every state that has passed laws permitting concealed carry has seen dramatic drops in violent crime. Maybe we don't need studies maybe some common sense will work. Lets look at some facts I think we can all agree on. 1) Criminals do not obey the law. That is why they are criminals 2) Criminals as a whole are lazy. Maybe another reason they are criminals, demanding prosperity without effort. 3) So it follows that criminals seek out victims / prey not opponents. Armed citizens are opponents. 4) It is for that reason that most all mass murders occur in so called "Gun Free Zones". Only the criminals have guns in those areas 4) Less restrictive gun control means more law abiding citizens could be armed. Which means what to the criminal? I agree this is 2009 we should be far more evolved as a society. We should not have to need to defend ourselves from violent predators. Personally I run from fights and avoid bad areas and do all I can to avoid being a victim. Most gun owners I know do. I do not like packing a two pound pice of steel on my hip everywhere I go. I would have preferred to go on a cruise with my beautiful loving wife rather than spend the money on training courses guns and ammunition. God knows she deserves it. Heck I'd rather go on a cruise instead of paying for insurance too. But she deserves to be safe even more. Like my insurance, seat belts, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors I hope I never ever have to use my gun. There is a good chance I won't but I would much rather have it and never need it than need it and not have it. My niece did not think she needed one. She was right she didn't until the night she was dragged into a van where they kept her for four days and nights. A once stunningly beautiful young lady now covered with scars from knife wounds and cigar burns inside and outside of her body. The scars in her soul will never heal. She will never be the mommy she so wanted to be. She loved children so much that is where she was that night, working with under privileged kids. To this day she regrets not taking me up on my offer to a gun and training sooner. Today, she knows that the woman laying in the ally raped and strangled to death with her won panties is NOT morally superior to the woman explaining to the police why the rapist has two holes in his chest is. No that could never happen to you, it could not happen to her either. I'll close with some facts you can easily verify with a google search. Its is how I found them. Unlike the mass murders we have all read so much about armed citizens have managed to do what the police have never been able to do stop many mass murders. February 12, 2007, In Ogden Utah: Kenneth K. Hammond carrying a concealed weapon stopped a massacre at the Trolley Square Mall in Utah December 11, 2007, In Colorado Springs Colorado: After killing two people at a mission training school the killer drove 65 miles killing two more people in the parking lot before entering New Life Church carrying a rifle, two pistols and a backpack holding more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. intent on killing all 1,000 members inside the church. Which he would have done had Jeanne Assam not been there with her legally carried handgun. Jeanne Assam a member of the congregation (not a security guard as the media erroneously reported) stopped the killer before he could begin his massacre January 16, 2002, In Grundy, Virginia: Tracy Bridges & Mikael Gross stopped a mass murder at Appalachian School of Law, after lives were lost while they retrieved their guns from their cars, where they were required by policy to keep them. ( If college students legally licensed to carry concealed weapons been able to carry gun on school property no innocents would have died) 1998, In Edinboro, Pennsylvania: Restaurant's owner, James Strand stopped a killers rampage in Edinboro, Pennsylvania saving the lives of 240 students at a school dance a full eleven minutes before police arrived. One teacher John Gillette, 48, was killed October 1997, In Pearl City Mississippi: Principal Joel Myrick stopped a slaughter at Pearl High School with his .45 after lives were lost while he retrieved his .45 from his car, where it was required by law to be kept. (Had legally licensed school principles and teachers been able to carry his gun on school property none would have died) Obviously there is a pattern. Only those places that had an legally armed citizen were able to stop the rampaging mad men. The police were unable to stop a single killing not one. Nor is it reasonable to expect them to. They will only arrive in time to pick up the bodies. Isn't it about time to start looking at what works what saves lives? Stop creating law and policy based on what feels good and base our decisions on facts. On what works to save human lives *Guns are used 2. 5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Anti-gun Clinton researchers in a effort to discredit that study claimed that firearms used in self defense saved ONLY 1. 5 million lives a year. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are only 1. 5 million cases of self-defense with a firearm every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of "Guns in America" a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606) (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high." (George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards'?," Newsweek) * Concealed Weapon Permit holders are the single most law abiding segment of the population. More law abiding than doctors, judges, law enforcement and ministers (From FBI crimes statistics) As I have said in a perfect world this would not need to be a topic of conversation, there would be no rage hate greed and selfishness. Ideally we could keep guns away from criminals. Than there would be no need for guns. But this is not a perfect world and the laws based upon ideals has only managed to take guns away from the rational and law abiding. Causing all of us to be out gunned unarmed and defenseless in the face of evil. Maybe it is time to make laws based on the realities of 2009 and support the rights of law abiding citizens to defend themselves. Maybe it is time to do something we know works. Maybe it is time to take some personal responsibility and accountability for our won safety and well being. Stop demanding that the state and the police do the impossible. Maybe it is time for the criminals to be afraid";9;0;3;"Gun control would do nothing to reduce crime in the United States."

Guns take more time to deploy and therefore there is a higher chance that the aggressor will come to their senses if it was a crime of passion. Fourth, gun banning won't do anything.

Courts have in the past ruled that certain laws must be kept in place, because people have grown to expect this right.

It is of course much more complex, but the basic argument is that, the people have had the right to weapons forever, and they have a resonable expectation to continue to have that right. Also, you ignore the true argument that the Supreme court made in its favor, the argument that the people of D.C. have the right to protect their property from threat, a gun gives them that right. Remember a rifle would be an unrealistic defense, because of its length, and loading time, a hand gun would be ideal for defense, and at the very least may be more effective than rifles. So basically, it completely circumvented the whole arument about what a militia is. Thus making the right decision, with a more suitable argument. Also, you have another problem, the Gov't has banned militia's, its not legal for me and my friends to form our own private militia and march around like Nazi storm troopers...

Having been granted life all beings have the inalienable right to sustain that life and protect it by whatever means available. This amendment more than another separates us from all other forms of government. Our right to bear arms puts the government on notice that it exists at our whim solely to serve the people. That we have the right responsibility and ability to stand up against it should it ever cease to serve the people. Without the second amendment we would become subjects not citizens. Washington DC's gun ban has made it the murder capitol of the Nation. For 32 years the most violent city in the country. Consistently having the highest murder rate in the union.

Sometimes people over-complicate things in an attempt to explain them. It really is as simple as this: 1- The bill of rights, as a whole, was intended to recognize pre-existing rights (as opposed to granting rights) of the PEOPLE to be protected from abuses by the GOVERNMENT. 2- While there is a mention of militia, the actual right is still identified as the PEOPLE's right. 3- The Constitution, if it is to be interpreted (which I think it shouldn't be, but that is beside the point) MUST be interpreted using the definitions and conventions in place at the time it was written. The militia of today (Nat'l Guard) is NOT the militia of 1776 (an armed citizenry banding together to overthrow a tyrannical government). Feel free to oppose the idea of a right to bear arms if you wish, but don't deny what the Second Amendment clearly recognizes and try to twist the meaning of words, or confuse the clear intent of the framers.

While slavery was at one time legal, it was not legal as a result of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.

Your argument appears to be hollow and in fact, the ratification of the 13th Amendment shows as another example of the the importance of the Constitution and it's amendments and the protections they provide. If you wished to show how a Constitutional Amendment may be wrong, you would have a better argument using the example of the 18th Amendment (Prohibition) being ratified. Prohibition only served to create problems and launch criminal dynasties that remain to this day. It is the ONLY Constitutional amendment that has been repealed and, not coincidentally, was an amendment born out of social pressure, public opinion, and personal beliefs rather than a legitimate legal process respecting our rights.

If you need an M16 to defend you home, leave Philly and go some place where your desert eagle is sufficient. People don't need ridiculously powerful weapons, unless the do in fact plan to form a well regulated militia and patrol the streets. well, I think you may be missing the whole point of the 2nd amendment. Here are some quotes from this country's founding fathers they may bring the 2nd amendment and the need for "ridiculously powerful weapons" into focus a bit. here are the quotes: George Mason: "To disarm the people is the most effectual way to enslave them." "Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every country in Europe." - Noah Webster "Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense? Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction, and having them under the management of Congress? If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?." - Patrick Henry "When once a Republic is corrupted, there is no possibility of remedying any of the growing evils but by removing the corruption and restoring its lost principles, every other correction is either useless or a new evil." - Thomas Jefferson So owning guns is the only way of enforcing the Constitution and guarantying our rights. This is what scares the crap out of me: Adolf Hitler: "This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration. Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead." (Chancelor's Speech, 1935) Adof Hitler: "The most foolish mistake we could make would be to allow the subject peoples to possess arms. So let's not have any talk about native militias." (Hitler's Secret Conversations, 1941-44, Farrar, Strauss and Young, 1953) I have heard this kind of talk from more than a few politicians, and we know what happened to Germany. Here are some quotes from a few people you may know: Diane Feinstein: "US Senator, If I could have banned them all- 'Mr. and Mrs. America turn in your guns' -I would have!" (Statement on TV program 69 Minutes, Feb 5 1995) Bill Clinton: (US President, has sworn an oath to defend the US Constitution, (not to violate it, criticize it, and belittle it)) "When we got organized as a country, [and] wrote a fairly radical Constitution, with a radical Bill of Rights, giving radical amounts of freedom to Americans, it was assumed that Americans who had that freedom would use it responsibly...When personal freedom is being abused, you have to move to limit it." (April 19 1994, on MTV) Charles Shumer: (US Congress, has sworn an oath to defend the US Constitution) "All we ask for is registration, just like we do for cars." (Press conference, 1993, exact date being sought) I find those quotes unsettling considering what Hitler did. I end with this quote for a peaceful man you all know who he is and what he preaches, peace.

Of you could manage to legislate firearms out of existance, then the real work would begin, and that is creating a society where people do not understand violence as a legitimate tool of influence. Part of the problem with many bans on weapons is that people tend to underestimate the commitment to violence that exists in their societies. Modern Zimbabwe is much more violent than the United States, yet you hear very little about shootings - it's mainly beating and dismemberments with machetes. What would you do there to stem the violence, ban bladed implements and trees?

When the Firearm Safety Act was passed which put massive restrictions on the ability of people to own the same tools as the government which up until its passage shortly after the turn of the century had been the case.

You bring up the example of campuses (I assume you refer to universities), what exactly is it that makes a normal sane American citizen, who chooses to carry a pistol when not on campus, suddenly make them turn into a psychotic murderer just because they pass over an imaginary line on the ground. How much sense does it make for a person to be considered law abiding on one side of the street and then a law breaker on the other just because of an object. It should be clear that telling someone to exercise a right only while in the home and not while outside the home IS infringement.";9;1;3;"Agaist Gun control"
1251;"gun control";"Citizens being active in the government is a wonderful goal and I encourage everyone to do so, however, an individual citizens rights are easily trampled by a much larger government unless that citizen has the tools to help level the playing field. You say that the government should fear the people yet you take from them the means to instill that fear. It is written in the Constitution that it is every citizens duty to overthrow the government should it become too tyrannical, and history has shown that the most effective method with which to do that is through force. When bringing up states rights, how can you explain the contradiction that the framers intended the states to have the majority of the power with the idea of a federal gun control law overriding the will of the states? And on to machine guns, is it possible to live in a society where machine guns are able to be acquired by the general populous... yes it is because it is possible to own a fully automatic machine gun if one has the desire to do so. There is a ban on the import of fully automatic firearms into the US since the 1980's and they are no longer manufactured here at home any longer either. That does not mean that you can not purchase one if you want, the fact is that because only pre1984/1985 machine guns are the only ones on the market they are not sold lightly and cost upwards of $20,000. Since the law was enacted there has only been one reported case of a machine gun used in a crime, and it was not by a citizen, it was committed by a police officer with a department firearm. If the idea is to control firearms to the point that citizens no longer have access to them then there is no point for the police to have them seeing as how law enforcement is statistically more of a menace than is the citizenry.";9;1;3;"Agaist Gun control"

2802;"gun control";"The United States Constitution is very specific in its wording from the preamble, through the articles and the amendments. The Preamble opens with "We the People of the United States" and it is very clear that People refers to individual citizens. The word people throughout the constitution in the same context. Amendment 10: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." The wording in amendment 10 is extremely clear. Any power not specifically granted to the U.S. is reserved for the States respectively, or to the people. Amendment 2: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." The prefatory clause mentions that a well regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free State. This implies that the freedom of the State is of paramount importance and a well regulated militia will maintain the security of the State. The operative clause uses the word people and not state or militia. The people (all citizens) make up the militia and those people have a right to both keep and bear arms. This clearly implies that the individual person has a right to own and carry arms. The operative clause does not mention the militia, nor does it mention the state. It specifically refers to the people. Another key phrase in the operative clause is "shall not be infringed." This language is again, very precise. From the Oxford Dictionary: Infringe: 1 violate (a law, agreement, etc.). 2 encroach on (a right or privilege). Oxford: Encroach: 1 (encroach on/upon) gradually intrude on (a person’s territory, rights, etc.). 2 advance gradually beyond expected or acceptable limits. Thus the prefatory clause implies that for a State to secure its freedom a well regulated militia is necessary. The operative clause clearly states that the right of the people to own and carry arms shall not be gradually intruded on or violated. Thus, the 2nd amendment implies that any law restricting specific types of firearms, inconveniencing the ownership of firearms (through sales or import restrictions, for example) or taxing firearms without representation is prohibited. The 10th amendment clearly states that the State and the People are guaranteed all rights not granted the U.S. government. No right to restrict or regulate firearms is granted the U.S. government, thus such rights are reserved for the States and the People. Furthermore, the 2nd amendment guarantees the State security and the People the right to own and carry arms, and specifically grants the People immunity from infringement on that right. Any form of arms regulation is a gradual encroachment, or infringement, of that right. Thus, the second amendment "flat out" DOES pertain to the regulation of who can sell arms, who can buy arms, for what purpose arms can be used, and wehere arms can be carried. The second amendment guarantees that the people have the right to own and carry firearms with no encroachment upon that right. The tenth amendment further guarantees that since the U.S. government was not specifically granted the right to regulate firearms in any way, shape or form, that the right to regulate firearms is thus reserved to the State or the People. The second amendment protects the people from infringement to that right. Thus, by viewing the Constitution of the United States in its entirety with both the second and tenth amendments, any regulation of firearms is unconstitutional.";9;1;3;"Agaist Gun control"
3453;"gun control";"I can agree in concept the "regulation" is Constitutional. The problem is when "regulation" is used as a means of "control". Licensing sellers as other businesses is fine, but when you start adding requirements based on what is being sold, you are now limiting where those business can be and controlling the access. If you make arbitrary and capricious decisions on who can sell them, you have also now controlled and limited that. These are infringements on a persons chosen business. Licensing buyers is an even greater form of control. Remember poll taxes? I think all will agree that when you start putting obstacles up to those trying to exercise a right, you are infringing on that right. By it's very definition, "regulation" limits and controls what can and can't be done. These regulations, or limitations, encroach on others privacy (tracking purchase and possessions), choice (why is freedom of choice is only good when it comes to abortion?), as well as other things. Not coincidentally, "To encroach on someone or something" is the most relevant definition of "Infringe". Abortion is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution, yet a "right to privacy" issue in 14th Amendment has been stretched to the point of legitimizing the taking of a life as a private matter the government cannot restrict. It would seem to be fair then that ownership of weapons would also have privacy protections and 4th and 14th Amendment protections regarding property and effects should afford protections to own firearms as well. Thankfully, we don't need such in depth interpretation and extrapolation to stretch these Amendments to provide the protections we seek, instead we were provided with a simple, direct, and clearly worded protection in the 2nd Amendment - "The right of the PEOPLE to keep and bear arms, shall NOT BE INFRINGED".";9;1;3;"Agaist Gun control"

What a totally absurd misleading statement, with absolutely no basis in fact. I posted the below on another debate, but it applies here. Sorry for its length. It is as concise as I could get it Guns are tools of protection and self defense. "Firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives." Why would anyone tale away the one thing that gives the peace loving law abiding an advantage over or at least equal footing to the evil and violent? No peace loving does not have to mean voluntary victim. If your assumptions are right than why does Washington DC which has a virtual ban on all guns consistently have the highest murder rate in the nation? While Vermont the safest state in the Union has no gun control laws permitting any adult to purchase any gun they wish and carry it as they wish without a permit license or waiting period. In study after study the evidence shows that states with the least restrictive laws regarding the ownership and carry of guns by law abiding citizens are the safest. Many researchers no most researchers who study guns and their effects on society like Lott and Kleck were pro gun control advocates prior to their research. After their studies did a complete 180. Coming around to support even advocating law abiding citizens civic duty to carry a gun. There are in fact many studies of countries that have banned gun completely that do show that after a dramatic increase in gun violence immediately following the gun bans. There is a significant drop in gun violence, after a few years. There have been claims that in countries that ban guns, there is a marked drop in gun violence. Recently those studies have been exposed as being inaccurate and distorted to support the gun bans. But lets accept that they are true. That gun bans do reduce gun violence. I can accept that as fact. But the statement is misleading because violent crime, rape, armed robbery, murder, and assault with a deadly weapon increased dramatically. Even double and still rising. In England teachers, even students are required to have bullet proof vests actually knife resistant vest. Because knife and sword attacks are now so common. In fact England has recently outlawed Samurai swords to go along with their gun ban. Kitchen knives and scissors are sure to follow suit shortly. FBI surveys reveal convicted criminals stating that they avoid victims that they think may be armed. Maybe that is why most criminals support gun control. Every state that has passed laws permitting concealed carry has seen dramatic drops in violent crime. Maybe we don't need studies maybe some common sense will work. Lets look at some facts I think we can all agree on. 1) Criminals do not obey the law. That is why they are criminals 2) Criminals as a whole are lazy. Maybe another reason they are criminals, demanding prosperity without effort. 3) So it follows that criminals seek out victims / prey not opponents. Armed citizens are opponents. 4) It is for that reason that most all mass murders occur in so called "Gun Free Zones". Only the criminals have guns in those areas 4) Less restrictive gun control means more law abiding citizens could be armed. Which means what to the criminal? I agree this is 2009 we should be far more evolved as a society. We should not have to need to defend ourselves from violent predators. Personally I run from fights and avoid bad areas and do all I can to avoid being a victim. Most gun owners I know do. I do not like packing a two pound pice of steel on my hip everywhere I go. I would have preferred to go on a cruise with my beautiful loving wife rather than spend the money on training courses guns and ammunition. God knows she deserves it. Heck I'd rather go on a cruise instead of paying for insurance too. But she deserves to be safe even more. Like my insurance, seat belts, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors I hope I never ever have to use my gun. There is a good chance I won't but I would much rather have it and never need it than need it and not have it. My niece did not think she needed one. She was right she didn't until the night she was dragged into a van where they kept her for four days and nights. A once stunningly beautiful young lady now covered with scars from knife wounds and cigar burns inside and outside of her body. The scars in her soul will never heal. She will never be the mommy she so wanted to be. She loved children so much that is where she was that night, working with under privileged kids. To this day she regrets not taking me up on my offer to a gun and training sooner. Today, she knows that the woman laying in the ally raped and strangled to death with her won panties is NOT morally superior to the woman explaining to the police why the rapist has two holes in his chest is. No that could never happen to you, it could not happen to her either. I'll close with some facts you can easily verify with a google search. Its is how I found them. Unlike the mass murders we have all read so much about armed citizens have managed to do what the police have never been able to do stop many mass murders. February 12, 2007, In Ogden Utah: Kenneth K. Hammond carrying a concealed weapon stopped a massacre at the Trolley Square Mall in Utah December 11, 2007, In Colorado Springs Colorado: After killing two people at a mission training school the killer drove 65 miles killing two more people in the parking lot before entering New Life Church carrying a rifle, two pistols and a backpack holding more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. intent on killing all 1,000 members inside the church. Which he would have done had Jeanne Assam not been there with her legally carried handgun. Jeanne Assam a member of the congregation (not a security guard as the media erroneously reported) stopped the killer before he could begin his massacre January 16, 2002, In Grundy, Virginia: Tracy Bridges & Mikael Gross stopped a mass murder at Appalachian School of Law, after lives were lost while they retrieved their guns from their cars, where they were required by policy to keep them. ( If college students legally licensed to carry concealed weapons been able to carry gun on school property no innocents would have died) 1998, In Edinboro, Pennsylvania: Restaurant's owner, James Strand stopped a killers rampage in Edinboro, Pennsylvania saving the lives of 240 students at a school dance a full eleven minutes before police arrived. One teacher John Gillette, 48, was killed October 1997, In Pearl City Mississippi: Principal Joel Myrick stopped a slaughter at Pearl High School with his .45 after lives were lost while he retrieved his .45 from his car, where it was required by law to be kept. (Had legally licensed school principles and teachers been able to carry his gun on school property none would have died) Obviously there is a pattern. Only those places that had an legally armed citizen were able to stop the rampaging mad men. The police were unable to stop a single killing not one. Nor is it reasonable to expect them to. They will only arrive in time to pick up the bodies. Isn't it about time to start looking at what works what saves lives? Stop creating law and policy based on what feels good and base our decisions on facts. On what works to save human lives *Guns are used 2. 5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Anti-gun Clinton researchers in a effort to discredit that study claimed that firearms used in self defense saved ONLY 1. 5 million lives a year. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are only 1. 5 million cases of self-defense with a firearm every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of "Guns in America" a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606) (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high." (George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards'?," Newsweek) * Concealed Weapon Permit holders are the single most law abiding segment of the population. More law abiding than doctors, judges, law enforcement and ministers (From FBI crimes statistics) As I have said in a perfect world this would not need to be a topic of conversation, there would be no rage hate greed and selfishness. Ideally we could keep guns away from criminals. Than there would be no need for guns. But this is not a perfect world and the laws based upon ideals has only managed to take guns away from the rational and law abiding. Causing all of us to be out gunned unarmed and defenseless in the face of evil. Maybe it is time to make laws based on the realities of 2009 and support the rights of law abiding citizens to defend themselves. Maybe it is time to do something we know works. Maybe it is time to take some personal responsibility and accountability for our won safety and well being. Stop demanding that the state and the police do the impossible. Maybe it is time for the criminals to be afraid";9;0;3;"Yes - it is obvious gun control laws don't work"

No that could never happen to you, it could not happen to her either. I'll close with some facts you can easily verify with a google search. Its is how I found them. Unlike the mass murders we have all read so much about armed citizens have managed to do what the police have never been able to do stop many mass murders. February 12, 2007, In Ogden Utah: Kenneth K. Hammond carrying a concealed weapon stopped a massacre at the Trolley Square Mall in Utah December 11, 2007, In Colorado Springs Colorado: After killing two people at a mission training school the killer drove 65 miles killing two more people in the parking lot before entering New Life Church carrying a rifle, two pistols and a backpack holding more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. intent on killing all 1,000 members inside the church. Which he would have done had Jeanne Assam not been there with her legally carried handgun. Jeanne Assam a member of the congregation (not a security guard as the media erroneously reported) stopped the killer before he could begin his massacre January 16, 2002, In Grundy, Virginia: Tracy Bridges & Mikael Gross stopped a mass murder at Appalachian School of Law, after lives were lost while they retrieved their guns from their cars, where they were required by policy to keep them. ( If college students legally licensed to carry concealed weapons been able to carry gun on school property no innocents would have died) 1998, In Edinboro, Pennsylvania: Restaurant's owner, James Strand stopped a killers rampage in Edinboro, Pennsylvania saving the lives of 240 students at a school dance a full eleven minutes before police arrived. One teacher John Gillette, 48, was killed October 1997, In Pearl City Mississippi: Principal Joel Myrick stopped a slaughter at Pearl High School with his .45 after lives were lost while he retrieved his .45 from his car, where it was required by law to be kept. (Had legally licensed school principles and teachers been able to carry his gun on school property none would have died) Obviously there is a pattern. Only those places that had an legally armed citizen were able to stop the rampaging mad men. The police were unable to stop a single killing not one. Nor is it reasonable to expect them to. They will only arrive in time to pick up the bodies. Isn't it about time to start looking at what works what saves lives? Stop creating law and policy based on what feels good and base our decisions on facts. On what works to save human lives *Guns are used 2. 5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Anti-gun Clinton researchers in a effort to discredit that study claimed that firearms used in self defense saved ONLY 1. 5 million lives a year. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are only 1. 5 million cases of self-defense with a firearm every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of "Guns in America" a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606) (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high." (George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards'?," Newsweek) * Concealed Weapon Permit holders are the single most law abiding segment of the population. More law abiding than doctors, judges, law enforcement and ministers (From FBI crimes statistics) As I have said in a perfect world this would not need to be a topic of conversation, there would be no rage hate greed and selfishness. Ideally we could keep guns away from criminals. Than there would be no need for guns. But this is not a perfect world and the laws based upon ideals has only managed to take guns away from the rational and law abiding. Causing all of us to be out gunned unarmed and defenseless in the face of evil. Maybe it is time to make laws based on the realities of 2009 and support the rights of law abiding citizens to defend themselves. Maybe it is time to do something we know works. Maybe it is time to take some personal responsibility and accountability for our won safety and well being. Stop demanding that the state and the police do the impossible. Maybe it is time for the criminals to be afraid";9;0;3;"Yes - it is obvious gun control laws don't work"

Banning guns gives the criminals a one up on us, which in turn does not make us equal. 3. I agree that the whole constitution is outdated, but what saves us from tyranny?

No it has not worked in the U.K. Violent crimes of all kinds are just as bad in the U.K. as in the U.S., they simply have a smaller population. Less people, around the same percentage. 2. By disarming police and law abiding citizens the only people left to obtain guns are criminals who are the ones committing violent crimes anyway. The only result is that the rate of gun related self defense cases would drop to zero while the rate of gun related crimes would stay exactly the same (if not increase). 3. Your logic falls apart on this point. If the 2nd amendment is outdated and therefore irrelevant in today's society, then the checks and balances (which were established at about the same time) are also outdated. There can be (and some would suggest already is) tyrannical rule in the United States. Our government protects itself from becoming too powerful but not any organization outside of it. The right of American citizens to form militias is and always will be an essential aspect of American society. What is a stronger force? Millions of Americans armed to the teeth or any invading military force from any country or countries? My money is on American citizens ever time.

In conclusion there are no good points listed that would convince me that "no one should own a gun, neither the citizens nor the police."

Some lived and some died throughout the struggle. But, the important part was they defended themselves and lived and died as free men and women. Still not impressed? Take a look at what the insurgents in Iraq did to the powerful American army with their dodgy guns and home made bombs. We had to pay them to stop killing us for Pete's sake.

A government becomes oppressive when the rights invested into it are seized from the people and used against them. The more rights a government has that the citizens do not, the more totalitarian that government is. Case in point is this: in order for a government not to be oppressive in terms of banning firearms, it must also prohibit itself from using firearms. This includes the military.

When that happens I want to be able to defend myself. I may not do a good job at it, but I want to be able to try. The Warsaw uprising is an excellent example of people defending themselves against a hostile government. Germany invaded and took over Poland. The Nazi's were the Polish government at that point. Regardless of how it came about, that was the fact. The new Polish government rounded up the Jews and killed them, except the ones who had their own guns. In Iran today the supreme leader is about to crack down hard on the protestors using the Iranian military. There will be bloodshed and the uprising by the people against a now illegitimate regime in Iran will be put down.

As I've stated, a government becomes oppressive when it holds rights the citizens themselves do not have. By prohibiting civilian ownership of guns, but not military ownership, you are already paving way for further oppression in other aspects of civil liberty. However, I should probably point out that a government can also become oppressive when it legislates restrictions on individuals that either do not DIRECTLY infringe upon the rights of others, or DIRECTLY diminishes the government's ability to defend civil liberties. Now I'm sure your counterargument would be that gun ownership infringes upon people's right to safety. However, the problem with this assertion is that (forgive me for resorting to the use of a cliche) its not guns that kill people, its people who kill people. Guns are merely a medium through which such acts are committed. In the same way, duck tape can be used to silence someone, thus infringing upon their right to free speech. This does not mean that firearms should be outlawed. Also, in order to outlaw guns under that rationale, logically you would have to outlaw ANYTHING that can be used to kill someone, which is a practical impossibility.

There are certain restrictions to gun ownership, thus eliminating the idiots from "legal" gun ownership. If stick to a purely logical argument, we can assume that criminals do not acquire guns legally in many cases. Therefore, those of use who would like to remain protected from said criminals should retain the legal right to own a firearm. The flaw in your logic is the assumption that a person who is not an idiot will realize they do not need a gun. If you can explain this, perhaps I can try to understand your logic.";9;0;3;YES

Think, if someone came in to your home, with a gun with the intent to rob you and if you get in the way, have no problem killing you and your family... wouldn't you want to have a gun in your hand? Were talking about protecting children's, spouses, family members. Having a gun in your house doesn't mean that you automatically don't mind being a killer, theres always a leg, or arm. If there were no guns, the violence wouldn't stop. People can attack with knives, baseball bats, machetes if they wanted. No matter what the world will be violent, and there will be evil, so there shouldn't be anything wrong with having a gun in your home to protect your family. The violence won't end, banning guns won't stop it. But this way, there will be peace of mind at night, and a back up plan under the bed.";9;0;3;YES

What if we slowly started to become oppressed by our own system? Say tomorrow order 66 came out and the whole country went on lock down. We're screwed if we don't have guns. Yes I realize you mean on the streets. But think of it this way - there are two types of people (besides cops) who need guns on the streets - those that use them in self defense and those that use them to threaten and kill. If we didn't allow guns, who do you think would stop carrying them? The ones that have it for self defense. The ones that mean to kill are already breaking a bigger law anyway, why should they listen to this "zero tolerance" rule? If you ban guns, the gunners win.";9;1;3;Pro-Guns
4825;"gun control";"So far, there seems to be a sort of false dichotomy between 0% tolerance and 100% tolerance. I'd like to briefly mediate that dispute, however, note that I err on the side of permitting gun ownership, albeit under effective supervision. More or less, the statement that "when guns are outlawed, only outlaws will own guns" is true. It is arguably true that a ban on guns might act as a deterrent to the more cowardly criminals, however, the majority of criminals who use firearms do so on a fairly regular basis, which means that strict anti-firearm legislation, rather than preventing the abuse or illegal distribution of firearms, will only force criminals to become more resourceful in order to obtain the tools of their trade. The same may be said for prohibition and the War on Drugs, both of which have proven extremely ineffective. Interestingly, both of these cases also demonstrated a significant increase in related crime. In the case of prohibition, organized crime centered mostly around the protection of speakeasies and the clandestine proliferation of alcohol--in other words, bootlegging. With the War on Drugs, we can see a similar problem with the amount of sheer power that drug cartels have gained since the United States' decision to crack down on illicit substances. Given these two historical cases concerning the lack of efficacy of legal prohibitions, it seems counterproductive to reducing gun-related and gun-aided crimes to ban firearms entirely. This whole argument, of course, says nothing of the basic argument that we have a fundamental right, guaranteed by the Constitution and repeatedly upheld by the Supreme Court, to maintain a stock of firearms for the sake of personal security. Now, to the credit of my anti-gun friends on the other side, I also don't agree with gun-loving conservatives who claim that our ability to own guns shouldn't be infringed upon in any way, shape, or form. There are two reasons for this: 1. Conservatives are notoriously hypocritical regarding ownership of weapons. Their creed, famously repeated, is that guns don't kill people--people kill people, yet when it comes to the subject of other countries owning weapons--nuclear weapons, especially--conservative advocates are outraged by the very suggestion that we allow them to develop such technologies. 2. Still, just as I believe that nuclear weapons in the hands of Iran or North Korea would be quite a mistake, so too would I object to the ownership of massive assault rifles, machine guns, large ordinance, etc. by ordinary civilians. If the reason for upholding gun rights is to preserve the average American's ability to provide for his own defense, we can hardly say that it is necessary for him to own firepower employed well beyond the range of home security. Consequently, we can conclude that, though the pro-gun position is clearly the more rational, it is at the same time in our best interests to formulate a set of heavy regulations to ensure that the firearms available to average Americans don't extend very far beyond the range of handguns and hunting rifles. In other words: preserve rights, but only within reason.";9;1;3;Pro-Guns

I mean can you think of an argument? or are you so dumb you make fun of my vocabulary. But back to the debate, My prime example used for my argument is Britans Ban on handguns. After the Dublane massacre in 1996 England decided in a near-unanamous vote to ban handguns. after that you can see that the rate of crimes involving handguns have steadily increased throughout the years. That not enough evidence for your feeble mind? Heres another example: After the port Arthur massacre in Hobart Austraila back in 1996 Austraila outlawed almost all guns. The result has been a steady clime in gun crimes in austraila. Austraila has even recently passed America in gun crime rates. Also In america after the columbine massacre in 1999 gun violence has decreased despite no gun bans. How could you disagree with me? Also if you want to argue against my statement make it rational.

First off lets just be honest here for a second it wouldent matter how much power you put into stopping people from having guns the bad guys like the Gansters,Rapest,pimps, the drug dealers etc. are always gonna find ways to get them and that leaves the innocent people helpless and dead. New York is a perfect example, The gun laws over there are so strict that its almost impossible to even own a handgun, and they have some stupid law to where your gun can be in the car but the ammo and magazine have to be in the trunk...(or something along those lines). quick question: how do you plan on useing your firearm if some thug comes up to you at a red light breaks your window and starts attacking you with either a gun or knife? you would either end up severly injured in the hospital or dead because you werent allowed to defend yourself. Another Thing i think is every college should allow a concealed firearm option for students. The NRA just announced that in the states of Arizona and Colorado thats students have the OPTION of conceal carrying a firearm on campus. i know this might sound idiotic and stupid but This would eliminate alot of school shootings and innocents getting hurt. 2 examples, Colimbine and Virgina tech. probaly the 2 most graphic school shootings in History, So many people died because they couldent defend themselves when they felt like their life was on the line. and Because stupid Cops have to go threw protical procedures and and by the time they arive at the school and go threw all the guidlines 10 more people just died. If students were allowed to carry on campus on thos days im almost positive their wouldent have been as many deaths as their was. Guns are not a evil creation that everyone needs to be afraid of and to never have, they need to be respected because of the power they poses and if handel correctly it can be a very fun sport. i also dont want to hear "Guns kill people" well if thats the case then pencils misspell words and Trucks cause drunk driving.";9;0;3;Lenient
5152;"gun control";"rubberducky pretty much hit the nail on the head for this one. Prohibition, as we've seen throughout history, almost never works to the degree it is expected to. In nearly every instance, whether it be drugs, alcohol, firearms, etcetera, one a prohibition is in place, a black market will emerge. This means that individuals who are inclined to engage in illegal acts are now more advantaged to get whatever it is that is prohibited (in this case, guns). Said prohibition, leading inevitably to a black market due to remaining (and sometimes increasing) demand means that individuals who engage in illegal activity will continue to do just that while well-to-do citizens are left worse off. A criminal will always be able to find a firearm, and will always want to use it to commit crimes. The best way to counter this affect is to allow those who have no intention of committing crimes to protect themselves with equal power from those who wish to do them or their families harm.";9;0;3;Lenient
