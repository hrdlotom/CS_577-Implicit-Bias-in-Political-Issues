But promoting amnesty only promotes the illegal activities of coming into the country illegally. I spoke with someone whose family was a paper family. He was torn on the issue.

But I say, "I've made all the beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors. I've done all the things you don't like to do. I'm hard-working and honest (except for when I broke into your house). According to the protesters: · You are Required to let me stay in your house · You are Required to add me to your family's insurance plan · You are Required to Educate my kids · You are Required to Provide other benefits to me and to my family (my husband will do all of your yard work because he is also hard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part). If you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my friends who will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my RIGHT to be there. It's only fair, after all, because you have a nicer house than I do, and I'm just trying to better myself. I'm a hard-working and honest, person, except for well, you know, I did break into your house. And what a deal it is for me! I live in your house, contributing only a fraction of the cost of my keep, and there is nothing you can do about it without being accused of cold, uncaring, selfish, prejudiced, and bigoted behavior.

If I murder someone, but then do all sorts of great things for 10 years, and the murder comes up, should I be granted immunity for my crime because it happened so long ago? Why would it be different if I broke into the country and refused to pay taxes for years? There is no statute of limitation on these things.";16;1;0;"Illegal inmigrants shouldn´t be given rights citizenship after all."
2269;immigration;"This issue has nothing to do with racism, and everything to do with following the law. Proponents of Amnesty would have us throw out the immigration laws this country was founded upon, so that people who didn't bother to follow them wont be punished. I'm sorry, that doesn't work for me, and it shouldn't work for you, either. I don't care whether the overwhelming bulk of these people are "law abiding (although they broke the law by entering the country illegally)," tax paying, family people- unfortunately that's not the issue here. The issue is they chose not to follow the laws regulating the inflow of immigrants into this nation. They ignored the sovereignty of the United States to declare under what circumstances a person can enter this great nation, and they demand the Government look past their crimes, and grant them citizenship. That's not the way it works! Why is it, I ask you, that we should bend the rules for this select group of people? Why is it that we should throw out the laws, because they are decent hardworking folk, who pay taxes, and contribute socially? This insinuates that no other group of immigrants to come to this country were as great as the ones now here, "living in the shadows." Why should the rules be bent for this group, and not, say for the displaced Jews of WWII? These immigrants had to flee execution in their homeland, and endure the tough (but fair) immigration procedures once they arrived here. They paid the fees, they waited in line, they took the test, and now we should spit in their faces and declare the 20 million illegals citizens because it would be 'cruel' to send them back? There are a few select things that make a country a country, two of which are border and language. Are the Mexicans racists for not offering their government services in English? Are the Canadians racists for enforcing their borders and deporting illegal immigrants from their country? Somehow the answer to both of these questions is no, but we here in the US are racists for doing these same things. Oh, and just one final note... The US didn't steal the land we call California, Arizona, New Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada and Utah from Mexico. After winning the Mexican-American war, the United States deferring it's right to take the land in question, instead paid $15,000,000 dollars for the area, and benevolently forgave $3,250,000 in debts owed by the Mexicans to the US. BTW, in today's money, that would be roughly $313,000,000 and $68,000,000 respectively.";16;1;0;"Illegal inmigrants shouldn´t be given rights citizenship after all."

1851;immigration;"Perhaps you are thinking of a different country, or a different route of entry into the United States. There are many who travel by foot or vehicle over the southern border of the United States - and a fence would be a significant deterrent.";16;0;0;"A fence should be built on the US/Mexico border"
1580;immigration;"WE did not rob any Native Americans. Some of our ancestors did. I am descended from a more recently immigrated family, personally, but that is certainly off topic. Now, the authority that prevents you from crossing a border is national legal authority. The people of the country as a collective have authorized the elected government to create a nation, and limit people coming in. You seem to be an advocate of the natural rights of man, to which some imagined border is absurd, however, keep in mind that the natural state of man is to kill before being killed and to live under no set of law of values. In addition to authorizing a government to limit these natural freedoms (freedom to kill), we have authorized them to limit freedom of movement (whether it be preventing an invasion of armed foreigners or illegal entrants to the country). Natural rights, as you call them, no longer exist in our society, we have cast them off in the name of safety and progress. This is NOT to say that stopping immigration is a safety concern! But it is among the other natural freedoms that government controls. And Americans do have the right to not like immigrants, if that is their choice. Our country offers very beneficial, very expensive services to our citizens, everything from roads to healthcare (which is nearly nationalized... people can not be denied emergency room care, so in places like the corruption riddled Medicaid system of NY, there are plenty that use emergency room visits for standard illness while the state foots the bill). To come in without gaining legal access, and to still take advantage of these services can rightfully be considered abuse of the taxpayer. While this does not compel me to be fully against immigration, I understand the argument. ---------------------------------------------------------- Back on topic, I consider a wall a reasonable idea. It is a more efficient way of stopping illegal immigration than manpower alone. It at least serves as a minor deterrent, better than the current NOTHING. If we are going to restrict immigration (this debate is NOT on whether immigration is good or bad), then some sort of barrier seems like the obvious starting point.";16;0;0;"A fence should be built on the US/Mexico border"

2531;immigration;"A fence would be an added deterent in the battle to stem illegal immigration into the United States. A slow down has already been seen in the areas along the border which now have the new, strenghtened fencing. Any fence, of course, would have to go hand-in-hand with enforcement, i.e. Border Patrol Agents, Border Inspectors, etc. The argument from some, who equate a fence along the U.S. border, as some type of, "Berlin Wall," is completely mis-guided, as well as mis-informed. As I recall, the fence would be keeping people out, not in, and be in place to protect our country and our economy. This is just more hyperbole from those on the other side of the argument. This fence will not only deter illegal migrants from entering, but potential terrorists and their possible weapons they bring, i.e. nuclear material, bateriolgical, etc. Until the Mexican Government gets serious about its own economy and stops tryin to use the U.S. as a release valve for its unemplyed and as a vacuum for U.S. dollars back into its economy, the fence and increased border enforcement is the only viable method.

1580;immigration;"It was never meant to be anything more than a deterrent. I know it won't stop nearly all, but at least it makes it a little more difficult, cuts of at least ONE easy route. Will it solve the problem? No, but it will slow it slightly, and there is little reason NOT to do it. Cost is negligible compared to the extremely high manpower costs of covering an empty field of hundreds or thousands of miles, day and night.";16;0;0;"A fence should be built on the US/Mexico border"
2529;immigration;"Walls are effective, that is why people build them. The wall in Israel has worked very well. We have a small wall in place already on the border with Mexico, and it has been effective. The argument that walls won't stop everyone, is a silly one. Prison walls, or locks on you're house don't stop everyone, does than in turn mean that they should not be used at all? It is obvious that our national sovereignty is not respected, over 50% of Mexicans, feel the border is illegitimate, and the SW rightly belongs to them.

If there is no limit, then any lawbreaker can opt out of punishment under an appeal to "humanity" or the like. America has fought in many, many battles under the good for humanity slogan. We don't have to fund the UN. We don't have to give aid for peacekeeping. We don't have to have Bill Gates donate BILLIONS of dollars to help others who are suffering. We don't have to spread autonomy to the citizens of other countries. We don't have to give jobs to people in foreign countries. But we as Americans, do.

"Today the World Health Organization (WHO) extended its gratitude to the Canadian government for the Prime Minister's announcement of a contribution of CAD $ 100 million over two years for the WHO target of treating three million people living with AIDS by the end of 2005. " "Today, on World AIDS Day, International Cooperation Minister and Minister for La Francophonie and Official Languages, Josée Verner, outlined the government of Canada's long-term, comprehensive approach to fighting HIV/AIDS that builds on strong partnerships, and our experience of what works to deliver concrete results. Minister Verner announced that Canada will provide $120 million to support global HIV/AIDS efforts focussing on four key areas: prevention, strengthening health systems, promoting women's empowerment, and promoting children's rights. " How many jobs are we giving? Seeing as how Canada's employment rate surpassed the US's back in 2002, we have as much as we need to get by and then some. How lenient are we with ILLEGAL immigrants? "Estimates range between 35,000 and 120,000 illegal immigrants in Canada.[11] If already in the country, Canada does not ask any type of immigration applicant to re-enter the country for any extension or approval of their status." vs. "The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 8.7 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States in 2000, and immigration officials estimate that the illegal immigrant population grows by at least 500,000 every year.[102]" Why is that? Because we like our legal immigrants... they help our nation become stronger, therefore we have much more lenient immigration laws. "The three main official reasons given for the high level of immigration are: A. The social component – Canada facilitates family reunification. B. The humanitarian component – Relating to refugees. C. The economic component – Attracting immigrants who will contribute economically and fill labour market needs " Now feel free to say "Gee willackers, Mr. Unlabled, I didn't know Canada was much more than a stick in the mud because its hard to see when my heads up my ***." so I can say "Thats alright... you're learning.

Charitable donations for 2002 set a new high, rising 1 percent over 2001's total in current dollars, according to Giving USA, a report released Monday by the American Association of Fundraising Counsel's Trust for Philanthropy in Indianapolis. The estimated $240.92 billion in gifts equalled 2.3 percent of US gross domestic product. By Stacy A. Teicher | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor newsfeed, 2003 June 23 “Since 1950, America and her allies have spent about $1 trillion U.S. dollars on anti-poverty and aid programs for poor and developing nations. After World War II, U.S. administrations considered foreign aid to be a strategic weapon, believing it could fortify weak nations vulnerable to Soviet aggression, and every aid dollar for food, for industrial development, for basic infrastructure had beneficial political, social and military effects.” http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/4/1/192451.shtml “By nearly all measures, the amount of foreign aid provided by the United States declined for several decades but has grown in the past few years. After hitting an alltime low in the mid1990s, total foreign assistance (but excluding Iraq reconstruction) for FY2003-2005, in real terms, has been larger than any three-year period since the early 1990s. The 0.16% of U.S. gross national product represented by foreign aid obligations for FY2005, however, is among the smallest amounts in the last half-century. The United States is the largest international economic aid donor in dollar terms…” “roughly the same time that fighting terrorism became the leading concern of American foreign aid, the Bush Administration announced other significant initiatives that have defined and strengthened two additional key foreign assistance goals: promoting economic growth and reducing poverty, and combating the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a new aid delivery concept, established in early 2004, that is intended to concentrate significantly higher amounts of U.S. resources in a few low- and low-middle income countries that have demonstrated a strong commitment to political, economic, and social reforms. If fully funded, $5 billion will be available by FY2006 to support these “best development performers” in order to accelerate economic growth and lower the number of people living in absolute poverty. Addressing global health problems has further become a core U.S. aid objective in recent years. Congress created a separate appropriation account for Child Survival and Health activities in the mid-1990s and increased funding for international HIV/AIDS and other infectious disease programs. President Bush’s announcement at his 2003 State of the Union message of a five-year, $15 billion effort to combat AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis has added greater emphasis to this primary foreign assistance objective. Beyond these recently emerging foreign aid goals, other prominent objectives that have continued since the early 1990s have included supporting peace in the Middle East through assistance to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinians, fostering democratization and stability for countries in crisis, such as Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, Kosovo, and Liberia, facilitating democratization and free market economies in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, suppressing international narcotics production and trafficking through assistance to Colombia and other Andean drug-producing countries, and alleviating famine and mitigating refugee situations in places throughout the world, including tsunami victims in Asia and east Africa.” “The U.S. assistance program to Iraq — the largest aid initiative since the 1948-1951 Marshall Plan — supports the long-term reconstruction requirements of the country following the March 2003 U.S. invasion and overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein. Funds have been mostly directed at improving the security capabilities of the Iraqi police and armed forces, at making rapid improvements in infrastructure — including electricity, oil, water and sewage, and telecommunications — and promoting democratization efforts. To date, two emergency supplemental appropriations have provided funds for these purposes (P.L. 108-11 for FY2003 and P.L. 108-106 for FY2004). The bulk of Iraq assistance — nearly $21 billion of the $23.7 billion that is expected to support the program — is held in an Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund controlled by the Office of the President and delegated to other executive branch agencies.” “Humanitarian Assistance. In FY2005, Congress appropriated $2.68 billion, 12.6% of assistance, for programs of humanitarian aid.3 Unlike, development assistance programs, which are often viewed as long-term efforts that may have the effect of preventing future crises from developing, three programs are devoted largely to the immediate alleviation of humanitarian emergencies. The bulk of humanitarian assistance goes to the refugee program administered by the State Department. It supports, with about $819 million in FY2005, a number of refugee relief organizations, including the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The Offices of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and Transition Initiatives (OTI) in USAID provide relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction assistance to victims of manmade and natural disasters, activities totaling $600 million in FY2005.” http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/98-916.pdf Now that is aid.

4053;immigration;"Just as I thought you can't answer the question. Well I'll answer it for you ok. You probably won't read it because truth have a liberal bias right. Quote from George W. Bush “I think when people take a look back at this moment in our economic history they recognize tax cuts worked, they had made a different" Here's the reality (the brute facts).1, Large income tax cuts are always followed by a large bubble and then a crash. 2, high income taxes co relate with economic growth. (Another words as income taxes goes up, economic growth goes up Income tax increases are followed by economic growth. Moderate income tax cuts are followed by a flat economy. All of this is especially true applied to the top tax rates. Here are the examples. The three great tax cuts we had sense the beginning of the 20th century (last hundred years) Hebert Hoover doing world war 1 the top marginal tax rate went up to 73%. In 1922 republicans took control of the house, senate and presidency and they began cutting taxes. They cut taxes rate down from 56% then down to 46% then in 1925 they cut income taxes down to 25%. (They cut taxes down below 30% just like Reagan did). The stock market took off there was a boom but the boom was a bubbles, it was follow by the great crash of 1929. Bank failures and the great depression. Then comes Reagan, from Roosevelt 's second term and all the way up to Jimmy Carter (1936 to 1982) the top rate was in the 70 to top 92% range. Then came Reagan in 1981, in 1982 he cut that to 50%. The economy immediately went into the worst recession sense the great depression. WHY cause Reagan cut taxes. Reagan's supporters argued it was a Carters fault and that the new policies will take time to work so the tax cut stayed in place. By 1987 there was another round of tax cuts, they took the top rate down to 38% and they said it would stimulate the economy, there was a boom but it was a bubble. In October of 1987, by the end of that year there was a crash (the worst sense 1929 and we still call it black Monday). Much of the bubble money was all gone and it went into reel-estate. Suddenly there were bank failures more then doing the great depression. Savings and loan crisis, we had to have a bail out. That what happen doing Ronald Reagan years in the 1980s. Now here comes George W. Bush two. He comes in the most healthiest and powerful economy in American history. Immediately he cut taxes. Top marginal rate down from 39 to 35%, also cut capital gain taxes, inheriting taxes and what happens, an immediate recession. But he persists economy doesn't grows much. It was accentual flat, and then there's a crash, bank failures and then a bail-out. On the other hand every-time taxes have been raised. Whether it was War World 2 1941 to 1945, taxes was 88 to 94% and what happen, the economy BOOMED (in another words got better for those who don't know what boomed means). Under presidents Truman and Eisenhower the economy BOOMED, Clinton raise taxes the economy BOOMED, Roosevelt raise taxes the economy GREW. Tax increases are followed by economic growth. Three of the four high growth periods in the last 100 years have immediately followed significant tax hikes. And the fourth, in the Truman and Eisenhower years begin with a top tax rate at 91%, they did not need a tax hike.";16;0;0;"should we put more time in trying to get illegal immigrants out of our country"

Seems like that always happens after 8 years of Republicans. I will say this. The U.S. was massively in debt after World War ll, our debt was great then 100% of gross domestic product. The U.S. borrowed more then we had to fight World War ll, and we paid it back HOW? not by raising taxes, taxes on the millionaires and billionaires was already 91%. We did it by increasing the economy. By giving people better wages, they bought things and stuff that stimulated the economy. When people are able to buy stuff, that increase demand, which then cause company and individual to start business that do the same.

4053;immigration;"STARVE THE BEAST When you cut taxes, but don’t cut spending (in another words you go into deficit spending. Which is what Ronald Reagan did, George Bush Jr did BIG TIME, George Bush Sr. did thought his presidency, and happen doing the first two years of the Clinton administration) you basically offering people $100 worth of government for $80. Because the other $20 is being thrown into debt and people don’t see it. Now the theory the Republicans had was that the extra $20 thrown into debt, is going to so horrify the public, that people going to say OH MY GOD WE GOING TO GO INTO DEBT LETS CUT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT. That was the whole theory of “starve the beast”, (David Stockman and Ronald Reagan) that by throwing the country into serious debt, people would start behaving more responsively. But in facts what happens, is that because you putting all that extra cost on the credit cards and it’s so easy to put expensive on credit cards that congress and the American people (both business community and indivisible community) start demanding more government services because they’re cheaper. You are getting government services for 80cents of a dollar. And so government is less expensive and so everyone wants more of it and that’s why government increase at a faster rate in the Reagan administration then it had since war world 2. The rapid increase in the size and scope in government in the last 80 years, (outside of fighting war world 2) was doing singularly, doing the 8 years of the Reagan administration and 8 years of the Bush administration when he (Bush) repeated Reagan horrible mistake. The enormous debt that Reagan ran up (the 3 Trillion debt) did not cause anybody to say oh my God look at the debt. On the other hand, when Bill Clinton came in, and he raise taxes to the point where we was actually paying $100 on $100 worth of Government, at that point then people who are buying Government essentially were using Government services (whether it's individual consumers, whether it's businesses that are paying the cost of Government services, or whether it's Government agencies that are having to now cover their own cost, you know the pentagon have to have a balance budget or what-ever :p) at that point they say ahhh this is kinda getting expensive lets slow it down. That's why in the last 6 years in the Clinton administration, we actually saw the size of Government and the total amount of Government services (when the inflation adjust to real dollars) decrease steadily for 6 years, and it starting exploding again under George W. Bush. The bottom line is tax cut (on the rich) all they do is blow up the size of Government and blow up debt. this is from the right wing web-site http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v26n2/cpr-26n2-2.pdf";16;0;0;"should we put more time in trying to get illegal immigrants out of our country"
4053;immigration;"saving America is simple and here's the good news. We know how this works, we know why this works, and we know how to get out of this. Franklin Roosevelt got us out of this the last time. The only problem that we have is that there are a BUNCH OF RIGHT WING CRAZY'S in the congress and in the corporate media who are going off about socialism (look socialism we can't have socialism look socialism). It's just amazing and that word should be band (kidded lol). Here’s the problem. IF YOU DEFINED SOCIALISM AS taking tax payer dollars and providing services to people, then do you want to do away with our socialist police departments, our socialist fire departments, our socialist roads, what about our socialist army, our socialist food and drug administration keeping our drugs pure and safe, how about our socialist U.S. department of agriculture culture that keeps us from dying fro salmonella, how about our socialist FEMA that comes in if we have a disaster (hopefully once it's put back together and elevated back to a cabinet position under the Obama administration), how about our socialist Schools (that some conservatives and libertarians want to privatize). The bottom line is we understand that republican policies and Conservative economics DEVASTATE this country and make a very small amount of people very rich. we saw it in the 1920s, 1930s, we saw it in the 1880s, the 1840s, the united kingdom saw it over and over again, we seen it in governments all over the world, we saw it down in Chile, Argentina etc, we've seen it all over the world. We can make it work. President Franklin Roosevelt figure out how to do it, and Obama can do it we just have to support him in doing it. $750 Billion dollars and a third of it being tax cuts ant going to cut it. Taxes cuts don't do SQUAT to stimulate an economy. That is a fantasy that was promoted by Ronald Reagan in order to justify in dropping taxes on people making more then $3.2 million dollars a year down from 74% to 27% and it was a LIE it was a LIE then and it's a LIE now it didn't work then and it doesn't work and it won't work. And Obama needs to back away from using tax cut for a stimulus because it's not a stimulus, in fact he needs to raise taxes because if you look at the history of this country and every other country around the world what you see is that when you raise taxes so you’re not paying so much interest on the debt, you start to balance the budget, you start to pay down your debt, and government appropriately spends that money to provide actual infrastructure. Practically on human infrastructure, let’s strengthen the human capital that we have. Let’s give everybody in the U.S. who's capable of going to college a free college education or at-least a very cheap one. Like you could do in the U.S. back in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s, until Ronald Reagan took all of that apart. In every industrialize country in the world it's just free, lets go back to that. Lets put in place trade schools those people who can't go to college or don't want to go to college.

So according to you me and you will only spend money on drugs and vacations lol. That logic is just so plan wrong Larry, and I won't drop down to your level and call you names to make me feel good. I have never seen people like yourself advocate for your corporate master. I like corporations, I just don't like when they offshore jobs for very cheap labor and drive down WORKING american wages not HOMELESS BUT WORKING PEOPLE LARRY so they can line their pockets. When people don't have money they can't spend, if people can't spend there's no demand. This is kind of long but please read it all. I try to put this in great detail and I'm starting out with minimum wage. Teddy Roosevelt (the republican president) talked about a living wage (http://www.ssa.gov/history/trspeech.html Highlighted in red SOCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL JUSTICE TO THE WAGE-WORKERS). President Roosevelt talks about a normal standard of living and what is that? "normal standard of living a standard high enough to make morality possible" (another words you don't have to still for food), "to provide for education and recreation" (another words you put your kids thou school and you can have an vacation), "to care for immature members of the family", (another words raise your family and care for immature members of your family), "to maintain the family during periods of sickness", (afford health care) and "to permit of reasonable saving for old age" (to set aside enough money for your retirement). Teddy Roosevelt is the guy who created the phase "Living Wage" that's a living wage. It's absolutely crazy that so many people have to work for so little money that they have to go and ask for food stamps and show up at the food banks when people are willing to work. Teddy Roosevelt laid this stuff out and it was radical stuff back in that day because that was the tail end of the robber baron era. And after the great depression (the first republican great depression in the 1930s) we started taking this seriously and saying, you know we should have an economy where's if somebody is willing to work a 40 hour week (well 40 to 50 hours the debate back then) that they should be able to put their kids thou good schools, have and keep their homes, be able to take a vacation, be able to cover a hundred percent of their medical expenses without any problems, and they should be able to set aside enough so they and retire with grace and dignity. (This was a Republican President Teddy Roosevelt) That’s the American Dream. The American Dream is not hitting the lottery, it's not getting rich, The American Dream is having a living wage. And 28 years of republicans have stolen it from us. Obama needs to raise wages and getting more disposable income. Not over the short term with a quick tax cut or with a rebate but actually raising wages. Pass the employee free choice act, strengthen the rights of workers in the work place, and INCREASE the income tax on million and billionaires. Roll back the Reagan tax cuts forget about rolling back the bush tax cuts, ROLL BACK THE REAGAN TAX CUTS. If you want industrial growth in the U.S. like we had from 1940 to 1980, we had that because we had a 74% to 91% top income tax rate on people making more then $3.2 million dollars a year in todays money. And why did that stimulate the economy? and why did that build the economy because people making more then $3 million a year at that point that say, you know if I take more money out of this company and put it in my own pocket I going to pay 74% income tax on it and that's crazy. You know I'm going to leave that money in the company and buy new equipment, you know I'm going to leave money in the company and build new factories, I think ill leave that money in the company and PAY my employee a better wage so we have less turnovers (which is VERY expensive to companies the turnovers) so we can actually run this business in a more component and coherent fashion. But you have all these right wing think tanks (and economically libertarians) out there that spread these toxic misinformation, destructive democracy conservative means saying stuff, like OOH if you increase taxes it slows down economic growth and it's not true. You can't find in instant in history when increasing taxes slowed down economic activity. In fact when Clinton increases taxes it BOOSTED economic activity. Enough said. Now pauses for a moment, look around and see if you can find anything that's made in the U.S., we don't make things in the U.S. anymore. The way you build an economy is by generating wealth, you don't generate wealth by selling lumber around the world (which is what were doing) or selling grain around the world, or letting foreign companies come in and buy our mining operations and our companies. You generate wealth by manufacturing things. We use to do that in this country. The primary productivity is manufacturing, and we seen manufacturing in the U.S. go from 30% of GDP under Reagan (when Reagan came into office) to 11% of GDP right now. That's the result of Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Bill Clinton (in particular), and George Bushes trade policies and economic policies.";16;0;0;"should we put more time in trying to get illegal immigrants out of our country"
