You feel the weight of a life on your shoulders. it goes on like this, giving the backgrounds of the mothers. Then it poses the statement: should you decide to abort either one, you may have robbed the world the beautiful mind of leonardo da vinci or the cruelty of adolf hitler. i think that every child has a right to live in this world, except in a few extreme circumstances...if it was an unwanted pregnancy, and only if the pregnancy is in the early stages. that is my view";3;1;2;Pro-Life
1855;abortion;"While this debate is made more palatable when said to be based on a disagreement between choice (democracy) or the lack there of (fascism) - I beg those on either side of the line to at least be honest with each other. If one holds firm to a belief stating that life begins at conception, any act which eliminates said life is by definition murderous and therefore wrong. Regardless of the reason of the life's inception, it is a life and no human being has a right to extinguish an innocent. If one does not believe that life begins at conception than they are able to 'choose' whether it is to be allowed (legal) or prohibited (illegal). So the debate should center on when life begins, allow those who believe it to begin post conception to bicker on the morality of abortion. Those of us who believe it to begin at conception are unable to debate, as it is an absolute in our mind and by definition is unable to be changed.";3;1;2;Pro-Life

1815;abortion;"It's often funny how we tend to spin facts to make ourselves feel better about the situations we create. In the case of abortion, we tell ourselves that since the baby has not yet fully developed into the recognizable human form, that it's technically not a human being. Therefore, it's not murder to end its existence. Following this line of thought, an apple seed is not technically an edible apple, so destroying a farmer's stock of seed is not immoral, since we are not ridding him of the final product he sells. Yet, it's pretty clear you're robbing him of his livelihood, regardless of how you phrase it. Just because a fetus is not fully formed does not mean it is not a human.";3;1;2;Pro-Life
1880;abortion;"You are mixing topics thereby creating fallacy in your argument. The debate is not to determine under what circumstances may murder be morally acceptable, rather, the legal (some may say moral) foundation on which one can state that an individual has the right to terminate pregnancy.

828;abortion;"Alright, let's break this down if we can. 1. Outside of rape or the 1% where a condom/birth control fails, women do have the right to choose not to have unprotected sex. 1a. For those who argue that people make mistakes and they shouldn't be forced to have a child and to raise them I want to mention 2 points, 1. there is adoption, and 2. Other simple mistakes such as driving home drunk and hitting somebody, pulling a trigger and not realizing the gun was loaded...and of course there are more. In these cases the person is still held accountable and has to pay for their actions, why shouldn't a woman who gets pregnant due to lack of protection? 2. Psychological Trauma - others here have mentioned that it is wrong to force a young girl to go through the trauma and pain of having a child for 9 months. Well I think both sides can provide cases where a woman has psychological trauma either due to having the child or aborting the child, so this point is null for both sides. 3. Finally, for those that think that since it is the woman's body and nobody can tell her what to do, then I ask this question, what is the difference between a baby seconds after delivery and second before delivery? Nobody would ever allow somebody to kill a baby seconds after delivery because it wasn't convenient, couldn't be afforded, etc. So why when there is no physical difference for the child is it allowed to be aborted? Ultimately, I feel that abortion is wrong and the only exception to that is women who are raped. I still feel it is wrong at that point, but I have personally seen what a rape can do to a woman and I would never try to tell them they have to be reminded on a daily basis of that horrible moment in their life. Outside of that, sex is a mature activity that should only be practiced if people understand the potential consequences (STDs, pregnancy, etc.)";3;1;2;Pro-Life

It is a mature decision to leave raising apples to people who are better apple farmers." The flaw in this metaphor is that an apple seed is not intelligent, not unique, not capable of thought or emotion. Whether the seed becomes an apple affects only whether Joe Schmoe in Wisconsin will drink juice in the morning, not whether the world and history will be changed through its actions or whether its personal experience will validate its existence.

This is a reasonable and humane resolution to the problem of parents who are unfit or who do not want a child. Give the child up for adoption. Don't kill the child. You said, "There are already so many unwanted children filling up orphanages (where they are often mistreated). Why should we bring even more unwanted children into the world?"

At conception, the embryo is chromosomally complete which is to say that it has all the constituent parts that are required for growth and maturation. All that is required are the same things that we all require: Food, oxygen, water and shelter. The only difference is the means by which the child can obtain them. To say that since it cannot get them by his/herself, the child isn't 'alive' is to also say that since a parapalegic can't get food/water/oxygen/shelter for his/herself, they're not alive either. Christopher Reeve after his accident wasn't able to get any of these by himself, but no one would claim that he wasn't 'alive'.

1842;abortion;"I found this: Using the term "person" is another way that pro-choicers avoid admitting that abortion is wrong. Many pro-choicers will readily admit that the unborn are human beings or living members of the human species but will then assert that the unborn aren't persons and because of this it should be legal to kill them. "Person" is a loaded word. Which means that for any number of pro-choicers, the term "person" could have the same number of different definitions. Make sure you ask, "What's the difference between a human being and a human person?" At first, a good number of people aren't going to have an exact criteria for human personhood. This is because they haven't actually thought about it and are just repeating what they've heard or read from various pro-choice organizations. If they don't know right away, give them plenty of time and then ask them, "Isn't it odd that you're discriminating against the unborn because they supposedly aren't persons, yet you don't even have an answer for what makes a human being into a person." Many pro-choicers will say that viability, the unborn's ability to survive outside the womb, is what makes a human being into a person. Others will say that mental processes such as self-awareness or the ability to reason is what matters. In the past, others used to say it was the color of your skin, your race, or your gender made you a "person" or was the deciding factor with regards to your rights. Unfortunately in recent history the term "person" and other terms like it such as "citizen" have been used almost exclusively to rationalize the enslavement, mistreatment or killing of other human beings. It's what our country did with slaves. It's what Nazi Germany did with Jews. It's what many countries did and still do with women. Any qualifications that disqualify unborn children from the arbitrary realm of human personhood, such as self-awareness, consciousness, ability to survive on their own, etc. will also disqualify other human beings like infants, people in reversible comas, those on respirators, etc. The fact is that all of these different definitions and categories for personhood are wholly arbitrary with no basis in fact or logic. Pro-choicers should have a very hard time convincing anyone why we should accept their arbitrary definitions of personhood and not the arbitrary definitions of the racist or sexist. Why should these qualifications be accepted instead of other arbitrary qualifications like height, weight, IQ, skin color, and gender? Can't think of a good reason? Neither can they. Pro-choicer will also use circular arguments to try to defend their arbitrary criteria saying, "the unborn aren't persons because they can't live outside the womb." You can ask, Why should I accept this criteria for personhood? "Because the ability to live outside the womb makes someone a person." They'll unfortunately forget that a newborn couldn't survive outside the womb if no one was there to feed or clothe the child. Pro-choicers will also use criteria that eliminates other human beings they consider persons like newborns or people with severe mental disabilities. Their criteria will at times also make certain animals into persons. For example, some pro-choicers say self-awareness, consciousness, or the ability to reason are what makes us persons. Guess what? Infants aren't self-aware until about 3 months while many animals like dogs, apes, dolphins, etc. can form conscious memories and are aware of themselves, others and how they interact with the world around them. So are these animals "persons" while the human infants aren't? If these animals are "persons" should we free these animal "persons" from zoos and give them the unalienable rights they deserve? Other pro-choicers will continually change their definition of "personhood" if you point out how their criteria eliminates newborns and includes animals. They'll then begin to conform their definition of "personhood" so that only the unborn fit into the non-personhood category. At that point, you can say, "Isn't it obvious that your criteria for "personhood" is wholly arbitrary? You're simply using the word 'personhood' and changing its definition as a way to discriminate against the unborn." Anyone can come up with a definition of "personhood." There is no reason why anyone should accept the definitions brought forth by the pro-choice movement. # posted by Jivin";3;1;2;Pro-Life

1857;abortion;"An embryo, unlike an unfertilized egg, has its DNA. As long as you believe that your DNA is indeed your "blueprint for life", there is an enormous difference. Unfertilized- it really is just a cell. But once the two join, a new, entirely different entity is created, separate from both sperm and egg. From here, no matter how big the changes seem, the embryo simply grows and develops... just like every other human being throughout his or her entire lifetime. As for many of the other arguments, including the lack of response and the fact that the embryo lives off of the mother... Let me give you a similar example: Think of a person in a hospital- unconsious (for now) and hooked up to a ventilator because he can't breathe on his own. (Keep in mind also that the chance of this person waking up and "getting better" in a few months is quite, if not very, good) Do you have the right to kill this sick person simply because he cannot, at this point, function on his own? Of course not! Instead, the right thing to do is to continue caring for him and nurse him back to health. The same is true for this embryo. He too needs a few months of care before he can go out on his own. I'm sorry, but that doesn't make you a parasite... and its nothing like being a clump of cancerous cells. It's simply being human. (By the way... its not like all pro-LIFE people are men who will never have to go through pregnancy... I happen to be female. As another side note: I have no problem with abortion ONLY IF the mother's life is really in danger... because then I'm still pro-life, only I'm looking out for the mother)";3;1;2;Pro-Life
1842;abortion;"I am in so many debates my head is spinning. So I will address only two of your comments. But first, Thank you for your honesty. It is refreshing to hear someone admit that they have changed their position. I know I didn't "win" you over, but your honesty is appreciated. one: YOU SAID: A final thought: criminalizing abortion doesn't stop it. It just makes it beyond regulation. History bears this out as fact: remember the stories of knitting needles, coat hangers, back-alley butchers charging $300 without anaesthetic? The best thing you can do, whichever side of the debate you're on, is to support education about birth control and make it as readily available to people as possible. RE: This argument might be a good argument if the unborn weren't human beings and if legal abortion was a good thing but that's exactly what pro-choicers are trying to prove. Would anyone ever argue, "Thieves will be forced into dangerous armed robberies if they aren't allowed to pickpocket legally." This argument also says that because some women might break a law prohibiting abortion that abortion should be legal. Pretty much every law is broken. Should we repeal these laws too? Two: You Said: Constitutionally, a human being's charter rights and patrimony begin at birth. Isn't that a clear definition? I mention it for rhetorical purposes only. Re: I submit that the subject of abortion is bigger than lawful definitions and goes to the heart of mankind's morality.That is speaking to the "Feelings" or inherent morality of mankind but many people need facts. Here is what I found: Human Embryology, 3rd ed. Bradley M. Patten, (New York: McGraw Hill, 1968), 43. "It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual." Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, (Philadelphia: W.B. Sanders, 1974), 17. "The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life." Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed. E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975), vii. "Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition." In addition to the consistent testimony found in medical textbooks, there is some equally conclusive evidence that exists on the public record. In 1981, a United States Senate judiciary subcommittee received the following testimony from a collection of medical experts (Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, Report, 97th Congress, 1st Session, 1981): Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth Harvard University Medical School "It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception." Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania "I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception." Dr. Jerome LeJeune Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes "After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception." Professor Hymie Gordon Mayo Clinic "By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception." Dr. Watson A. Bowes University of Colorado Medical School "The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter – the beginning is conception." The official Senate report reached this conclusion: Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings. This, of course, should come as no surprise since the American Medical Association (AMA) declared as far back as 1857 (referenced in the Roe. v. Wade opinion) that "the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being” is a matter of objective science. They deplored the “popular ignorance...that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.” Doctors knew it during the 1800's and doctors know it today.

Recognition of consciousness happens when you cause hurt or happiness to someone and for the first time you recognize it. Realizing your conscience is the first purpose to life. Birth, no matter how bad the life, gives conscience to a spirit though physical experiences. Without life your spirit would never know good from evil. In the case of an abortion that one opportunity for a spirit to get a chance to realize conscience is forfeit. That one choice to stop life is so crucial that it has been given the label of murder by most religions throughout history. It has been referred to in the Bible, Koran and many other religious text as the worst sin possible. Probably because God understands that abortion results in "damnation".

1867;abortion;"eithout going into details of the arguments etc. and or whether or not i support legislagtion one way or the other, I would like to point out something here. The crux of the issue is when life begins. Everyone agrees that once a baby is born, killing it is murder. Everyone agrees that one is (legally) allowed to remove a part of their body which is not a seperate living entity. i.e. thier left pinkie. And everyone agrees that the government should not be allowed to legalize murder. However, due to the fact that babies develop from a part of a body (i.e. ovum) into a seperate living body (i.e. a baby) there is contention of where the point of life begins. You have : from conception, from second trimster, from fully developed fetus, from partial emergence, from majority/head emergence, from cutting cord, and finally from cutting the cord. Now being this is not something that we can determine scientifically because what life means to some is deifferent to others, and even if we were to determine one to being the scientific begining of life, life is not neccessarily determined by biological or even concsious/psyche factors. However, we do need to legally define life for various reasons, one of which is abortion. The fact that religious people hold that abortion is murder is a moot point. It is a philosophical argument in the first place (as stated) and therefore one philosophy is not necessarily more correct than the other. Therefore their argument against abortion is simply saying that the government should not allow murder. And it is a compelling argument. In fact, it is EQUALLY as compelling as the pro-choice argument that life begins at breath. They are both based on the persons own and private philosophies and beliefs. So if the government were to vhoose any side of the argument, it would be the government IMPOSING their interpretation AND beliefs on the people. If they allow abortion, it is imposing the legalization of murder on those who believe that it is, If they ban abortion, it is invading the privacy of those people that believe that the feutus is not yet living, Its a catch 22, and as much as you argue each way: the side points, statistics, hangers etc, arguments are moot in the face of murder. And the imposition of religious beliefs is not a point either, for it is a debate which is a debate of beliefs in the first place, and either side is a belief.

It is a matter of time, but eventually, he can. It is the same with a sleeping person: if this person is not human while he sleeps because he makes no contribution to society, ought he not to exist? Or a person in the hospital? What contribution do you require from the bedridden that will deem them human? You might have to wait even longer for a terminally sick person to offer up a contribution than for a developing fetus which will soon be a joy-eliciting child.

1873;abortion;"Then can a woman decide to destroy her childs body?";3;1;2;Pro-Life
1858;abortion;"The issue of abortion is tricky in many ways. Pro-life supporters will use religion, claim that life begins at conception, and generally have a fit about any sort of abortion which they see as murder of the developing fetus. However, pro-choice supporters don't want to hear anything the other side has to say, they claim that what a woman does with her body is her own business, they say religion has no place in the debate, and they are generally close minded about the issue. To tell the truth, I used to be a big time supporter of the pro-choice movement. I followed along with the standard arguments, and I thought that it was overbearing for the government to tell a woman what she could and couldn't do with her body. I've since changed my thought process quite a bit. I now am a pro-life supporter, and here are my reasons and my thinking on the issue. This does not mean that I am right, or that I have the final or absolute correct view point on the issue, this is simply my opinion. First, let me say that I do support abortion when the woman's life is clearly in danger, or when she has been raped and is far too traumatized to carry the child, and her trauma will ultimately affect the child's quality of life. I would also consider abortion when a couple knows that their child will be so severely mentally handicapped that they will never live a meaningful life. However, I do not support abortions of convenience. There are ample methods of contraception available, from condoms to birth control pills to diaphragms, and these methods are widely available at relatively low prices. There is even the morning after pill if you have an accident, which I support as long as it's taken within the time frame (I think this is around 72 hours, but I'm not absolutely sure). Next, I feel that we have to hold society accountable for the choices they make. It isn't fair to allow a woman to say, "well sure, I was having sex, which I knew could result in pregnancy, but this baby is simply going to be a nuisance to me, I think I'll just abort the pregnancy and forget about it." I used to try to objectify the fetus and turn it into an object, but the fact still remains that we are talking about a child, not a piece of garbage. Only ONE PERCENT of abortions happen because of rape or incest, only SIX PERCENT of abortions happen because of medical reasons, 93 PERCENT of abortions happen for social reasons (for example, because the child was unwanted, or the child would ruin the mother's life). By week six at the latest, a baby's heart has began to beat, and blood is actively circulating in the body. Now, outside the womb, if someone willingly took actions to stop another person's heart from beating we would call them murderers, but if the "person" if you will, happens to still be inside the womb then it's fair game, and we can do what we please guilt free. 52% of all abortions occur before the 9th week of pregnancy, 25% happen between the 9th & 10th week, 12% happen between the 11th and 12th week, 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week, 4% happen between the 16th & 20th week, and 1% of all abortions (16,450/yr.) happen after the 20th week of pregnancy. I will admit that the majority of abortions do occur before the ninth week of pregnancy, but the heart is beating by the sixth week. If the abortion takes place after the sixth week, then it should be considered as an invasive action that deliberately stopped the heart beat and further development of what could have otherwise been a healthy and viable pregnancy. By week eleven, the baby is officially described as a fetus, and according to the statistics, 12 percent of abortions happen between the eleventh and twelfth weeks of pregnancy. Enough about the stages of development, let's look at contraception use in those who choose to have an abortion. Here's a statistic: Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use. 76% of pill users who have an abortion report that they used birth control inconsistently during the month that they became pregnant, and 49% of condom users reported that they used condoms inconsistently during the month that they became pregnant. This relates back to the responsibility. If you are not responsible enough to consistently use a method of birth control, and you choose to have sex, then you shouldn't be allowed to simply throw your pregnancy away because it is inconvenient at the time. Now, only 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users who were regularly using their birth control method became pregnant. This is sill a high number, but is much lower than the previous numbers. This also relates to responsibility. You chose to have sex, and you decided to use protection, good for you, you made a semi-responsible decision. However, you knew that there was no 100 percent protection, besides abstinence, and you still had sex. You have to accept the consequences of your actions and behave like an adult. Let's look at it this way, we allow women to abort their unborn children because they see them as inconveniences, obstacles, or unwanted additions that have come too soon. What happens when a woman has a child, thinking she is ready, and decides that it is unwanted, has come too soon, or is to much of a burden? Do we allow a woman to kill her toddler, child, or teenager just because it proves to be too much? I think not. What's the difference? Proponents of abortion say that abortion really isn't murder because the fetus isn't viable and able to live outside the womb at the time of the abortion, but this isn't always the case. And even if it were the case, and every woman aborted her pregnancy before the fetus was viable, it still doesn't change the fact that, somewhere down the road, the fetus would have most likely come to term and been a healthy, and very much alive, baby. My alternative, carry the child, experience the labor and delivery, and then if you still can't stand the inconvenience of the child YOU CONCEIVED THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, give the baby up for adoption. THERE ARE PLENTY OF COUPLES WHO ARE UNABLE TO CONCEIVE IN THE US WHO WOULD LOVE TO ADOPT THE CHILD THAT YOU WERE GOING TO ABORT AND THROW IN SOME MEDICAL WASTE CONTAINER.";3;1;2;Pro-Life
1858;abortion;"You say that religion and personal beliefs shouldn't be an argument when thinking about abortion. But isn't your whole argument a personal belief? You believe that women should be allowed to have an abortion, and should have control of their bodies. This is a completely personal belief. Someone on the other side, someone such as myself, believes that women shouldn't be allowed to abort a pregnancy for convenience, I agree that this is an argument about beliefs. If you take the factors of religion and personal beliefs out, then you don't have a basis for argument. You feel that it isn't immoral for a woman to have an abortion, and you believe that the government should agree with you and grant women this right. However, this isn't a right that all women will take advantage of, such as voting was, and it isn't a right that all women support. When women weren't allowed to vote, that was an issue that had nothing to do with beliefs. It was simply immoral to allow women to have a say in who governed a country that they lived in, and pretty much every woman was on board with the idea. What you are suggesting, abortion, is an issue that some women don't even support, and morals and personal beliefs can never be removed from the argument. Furthermore, the argument can never really be won because we all define the beginning of life differently, and there is no concrete way to describe something so abstract. Therefore we have no grounds to make an objective argument, and everything anyone says will be subjective, no matter how slightly so.";3;1;2;Pro-Life
1408;abortion;"It is absurd and immoral to murder an innocent human being. The common pro-choice argument is against the humanity of the child. However, this is also absurd. What defines a human being? Quite simply, a living organism with the DNA of a Homo sapiens. An unborn child, not matter how far along, fulfills all three criteria. - An Unborn Child Is Alive - Biologically, there are three criteria for life. These are as follows: To be alive, something must (1) be able to reproduce on its own, either sexually or asexually, either through mitosis or meiosis, (2) be able to sense and react to its surroundings, on a cellular or macroscopic level, and (3) be able to consume energy from its surroundings for sustenance, on a cellular or macroscopic level. A child fulfills all of these conditions at conception. A fertilized egg can (1) divide by mitosis, (2) exhibit irritability, and (3) consume chemicals from the placenta. Thus, an unborn child is alive. - An Unborn Child Is An Organism (As Opposed to A Body Part) - What distinguishes an organism from a constituent of another organism? It be able to sustain the conditions of life separately from another organism, and must have different DNA. Both of these are satisfied in a fertilized egg. We all know that an embryo has different DNA than its mother. In addition, at conception, the child is capable of surviving in an environment separate from its mother. In pregnancy, it is possible for a child to die and the mother live, and vice versa. Thus, an unborn child is an independent organism. - An Unborn Child Has Homo Sapiens DNA - This is pretty indisputable. The mother DNA is human, and the father DNA is human, thus the embryo has human DNA. Since an unborn child is alive, is an independent organism, and has human DNA, it must be a human being. As a human, killing it without justification is murder. Since an unborn child is still innocent, as it has never done anything wrong, killing it is unjustified. Thus, killing an unborn child is murder. If murder is wrong, then, so is abortion.";3;1;2;Pro-Life

God knows us from conception, and when we see that, we know God has a plan for each and every one of us! To have an abortion is to cut that precious life short and to keep that life from some amazing plans that God has in store for him/her. Stopping Abortion is key to restoring God's hope in the hearts of people, especially America, where these morals have basically been flushed down the toilet.

It was the man who raped her who did evil, and in return caused her to take action and have an abortion. In your example, they both made the decision to consent to sex and that always comes with reprocussions... whether you use protection or not. Condoms don't protect your heart, for example. But to get rid of the child like that.... it's sad. Its not the baby's fault, and there are always better options like adoption. Its sad that things like this happen! I know a woman who had an abortion many years ago and she has regretted the decision her whole life. She is a persistent pro-life volunteer at the Women's Resource Center and everything now!

Everyone always begin to give specific examples of reasons for abortions, such as rape. Here are some statistics for you. Over 95% of abortions are because of birth control, such as not affording the child, getting in the way of their job, too young, want to wait, etc. Only 1% have an abortion because of rape, 1% because of fetal disabilities, and 3% because of mother's help problems. By giving the excuse of rape, we are allowing 95% of all the women to have an abortion just because they don't want the child. In my opinion, you make the decision of having a child at the bed. I understand it must be hard to bear a child after rape, which is still only 1% of all abortions. But don't punish the child for his/her father's crime.

1865;abortion;"The main question that the whole debate is dependent upon is not that of who gets to choose, but what the unborn is. If the unborn is not human, than no evidence for the pro-life case is needed. If the unborn IS human, than no evidence for the pro-choice case is adequate. If the unborn isn't a human, than the pro-life movement has no ground to stand on, and the other way around. Now to answer that question, the unborn IS human. In order to prove this I will use two separate, but equally sufficient arguments. The Law of Biogenesis states that living things reproduce after their own kind, therefore human parents must reproduce human offspring. How would it be possible to have a nonhuman offspring from two human parents according to the Law of Biogenesis? The next argument begins with this question: Is a newborn a human? Some people like Peter Singer may say no, but the general population will say that a newborn is a human. From this we can say that there are only four differences between the newborn baby and the unborn fetus. These four differences are size, level of development, environment, and degree of dependency. Beginning with size, how does size determine the humanity of a fetus? Is a large person more human than a small person? Is Lebron James more human than Sarah Palin simply because he is larger? Next is level of development. A four year old girl doesn't have a functioning reproductive system, does that make her less human than an 18 year old woman? A 10 year old boy has a less developed brain, but that does not make him less human than a grown man. So how does the level of development matter to the determination of humanity? Next is environment. You change your environment nearly every minute. You are reading this on your computer now, tonight you will be in your bedroom, and tomorrow you will be at work. Does being at your computer make you less human than being at work? Environment is an invalid factor in deciding humanity as well. Last is degree of dependency. Many people are living on oxygen tanks, dialysis, food tubes, insulin, and inhalers. These do not make anybody less human, so it wouldn't be okay to kill them. The same applies to the fetus. The ability to be independent completely of anyone or anything is completely impossible, therefore nobody would be a human if we used this to decide.";3;1;2;Pro-Life

I feel it should not be used as a primary source of birth control. However, if it is (which I doubt severely), who are we to stop it? If a woman is irresponsible enough to continually get pregnant, do we really want this kind of woman raising children? Think about it. If a woman, any woman, has decided that she does not want or cannot care for a child, she is probably making the best decision for all involved. Why do you think there are so many people in the American criminal justice system? Many of these people probably should have been aborted. I know that sounds so cold and so cruel, but what good have they been to society? They've stolen, murdered, battered, defrauded, and so much more. I ask you, what is sadder, a lifetime spent behind bars or a life that was ended before it even began? And even more so, if they get the death penalty, aren't we ultimately performing an abortion, just many years later? We are aborting a member from society. I would be so bold as to say that if you are pro-life you are anti-death penalty. My point is, many women abort because they know in their hearts that they cannot care for a child, and cannot bear the thought of a child growing up in adoption agencies. Some may argue, "well, she shouldn't have gotten pregnant in the first place." Well she did, and unfortunately with pregnancy, once the ball has started rolling, that baby is coming unless something is done to stop it. I'm not heartless. I want children one day. And thankfully, I've never had to make the difficult decision of having an abortion. But if I ever were to be placed in that situation, I can't say what I'd do, but I'd certainly want the option there.";3;0;2;Yes
2341;abortion;"Unfortunately, this is one of those double standards that everybody hates so much. Sure, you've lent us your seed, but we are the carriers. We have more rights because of this. Your body is not stretched to unrecognizable proportions. You do not experience morning sickness. You do not risk your very life to bring a child forth into the world. Your life is not necessarily changed forever if you don't want it to be, but ours is. It is a double standard, I acknowledge that, but it is what it is. A man cannot and never will dictate what happens to me or my body. This is nothing more than men trying to control yet another aspect of the world. You all just need to accept that this is a woman's right, because ultimately it is a woman's burden. And speaking of burdens, what say you about all these children, these fetuses that are being "saved," that are being born to unwed teenage mothers? To crackheads? To the unfit and the unworthy? What say you about these babies? Where exactly do you think they are going to end up? Statistics are very grim for these children. It amazes me that everyone is all "save the kids!" "It's murder!" "Save the babies!" But as soon as the kid is born, nobody wants to help out, and then the same people who screamed "pro-life" are the same ones calling for welfare reform. Lol!";3;0;2;Yes

1256;abortion;"Abortion should be legal. For those who disagree, just try and imagine one of your relatives getting raped. You are saying that you would deny a fifteen year old girl the right to kill the fetus inside of her after she went through such a horrific experience. Can you even began to comprehend the pain and humiliaty that she is going through? Of course not, unless you had to go through the same experience. You expect her to go through nine months of hell because you think that its wrong for the fetus to die. Imagine her giving birth to the baby and watching it grow up. All she can remember everytime she sees its face is the night that it was created. How can she explain to the child that it wasn't made between two individuals who loved each other but by a man that took advantage of her and practically beat her to death. What a lovely bed time story to tell them. I bet you eat eggs but that doesn't alarm you. The fetus isn't even fully developed and most likely wouldn't feel a thing. I understand that abortion shouldn't be offered to those who were careless but think about rape victims. Not only do they have to deal with the memories but they also have to deal with people who scream at them and call them murderers when it wasn't their fault to begin with. People should be ashamed of themselves for commiting such acts.";3;0;2;Yes
1256;abortion;"MINIMAL?!?!? How can you even begin to describe such events as if it is some petty offense or of small stature. In most cases, these rapes also include being beaten. You are obviously misinformed about these occurances if you choose to believe it to be something that a young girl can get passed easily. These things tramatize children and tend to dwell in their minds reminding them of the mental and physical pain they were put through. Rape is a common thing in today's world so maybe you should do some research so you can at least develop an intelligente argument.";3;0;2;Yes
1256;abortion;"" baby is 8 years old" it wouldn't be a baby anymore. it would be a child. Besides the argument you have created has a totally different scenario now. This child has already been born and is becoming a functional member of society. The fetus isn't even fully developed and wouldn't know what was happening. How could the mother have not known that the child was her brother's. Was she sleeping with four other different men or was she raped several times. No matter which scenario you use, if the girl was raped then she should have the right to decide if she wants an abortion or not. How can you call abortion murder? The word murder is defined as to kill or slaughter inhumanly or barbarously. War is murder. The diseased animals we are fed is murder. These women aren't slaughtering these fetuses. Those who are denied the right to it are because of people like you. You are ultimatly an accomplice because you have left no other choice for these women.

422;abortion;"This may sound absurd, at first reading. Yet, I might be swayed by the argument, provided the following caveat is upheld: No person ought to be FORCED to voluntarily put their life on the line for the sake of another person. Every moment of pregnancy is risky - and a pregnancy (however naural) can and does, at any given time, endanger the life of the potential mother. At times, as in the case of a blood-pressure-rise induced annurism, this happens so rapidly, no measure can save the life of either the mother, nor the potential baby. Alternately, a pregnancy can indeed have life-long, crippling effects on a woman. While I value human life, I value ALL human life, that of the potential child (it is not legally one until the moment of birth), as well as that of the mother. I propose that IF a woman chooses NOT to host a foetus within her body (and subject herself to the real dangers associated with this), nobody has the right to interfere with her decision. At the same time, I would argue that killing the foetus would be equally as wrong as killing the mother. Instead, the foetus should be removed from the womb when the potential mother no longer wishes to host it. It should be, at this point, afforded all the medical treatment available to other humans. If it is viable (or, if you prefer the term, if God wills it), the foetus will survive and can be adopted into a loving family. If not, then it will die. That is not murder. That is not abortion. It is God's will/natural selection. Yet it also does not interfere with a woman's right to control her own body. So, why abuse the woman, making her carry the foetus for 40 weeks agains her will and likely suffer ill affects from it, then let some family bond with the child for 5 years, then asked a half-formed human to make a life-and death decision? It would seem much better to preserve each individuals rights! Do not , ever, interfere with a person's right of self-determination. Yet, do not make a decision to kill, either.

The flaw is that, the difference between an unborn child and a 6 year old is simple: the law. So there is a higher authority involved. Roe vs Wade set in place laws which governed the time of viability, which is reached once 28 weeks of pregnancy come about. That being said, there are people out there (crazies), who believe it is morally A OK to euthanize children up to the age of 6 using the reasoning of viability. According to them children have NOT reached viability yet, because they still depend upon you for the basic needs of life. A pretty horrible belief, but one held by some, in my opinion too many. Like the Nazi's who euthanized children under the age of three with physical deformaties. Like that wacko James Watson, (who didn't even discover the Helix, but stole his work from another scientist - btw). Still, a whacko. Luckily though, I don't think the government is close to that.

1842;abortion;"Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings. The American Medical Association (AMA) declared as far back as 1857 (referenced in Roe. v. Wade) that "the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being” is a matter of objective science. They deplored the “popular ignorance...that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.” Doctors knew it during the 1800's and doctors know it today. Human life begins at conception. Following are Just a Few quotes from medical Professionals, journals, and textbooks. Please take the time to read them. Human Embryology, 3rd ed. Bradley M. Patten, (New York: McGraw Hill, 1968), 43. "It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual." Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, (Philadelphia: W.B. Sanders, 1974), 17. "The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life." Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed. E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975), vii. "Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition." In addition to the consistent testimony found in medical textbooks, there is some equally conclusive evidence that exists on the public record. In 1981, a United States Senate judiciary subcommittee received the following testimony from a collection of medical experts (Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, Report, 97th Congress, 1st Session, 1981): Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth Harvard University Medical School "It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception." Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania "I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception." Dr. Jerome LeJeune Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes "After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception." Professor Hymie Gordon....Mayo Clinic "By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception." Dr. Watson A.

2267;abortion;"Pro Life. I’ve researched quite a bit on abortion. I was partially pro choice at first but after all I’ve read I’m totally pro life now. Pro choice people’s main argument is that women should have a right to choose. But then they overlook the fetus! Shouldn’t the fetus have a right to choose as well? Pro choice would mean ending a life just because of potential risks, while pro life preserves a life in the presence of potential risks. Analogy: Your child is going to be stabbed by a psycho. If you save him you run the risk of being attacked by the psycho, but if you don’t your child will definitely die. What do you do then? Isn’t it obvious? Also, a lot of pro choice people do not believe that fetus should be considered a life (so that they don’t have rights).They find it easier to just disregard the fetus because it doesn’t exactly look human yet. But it is scientifically proven that the heart of a fetus starts being 20 days after conception and brainwaves are given off at 40 days. If heartbeat and brainwaves are not considered signs of life, then all humans are not alive, we all shouldn’t have rights. Another main basis of pro choice argument is that pregnancy is risky for women. However, it is proven that abortion is four times deadlier than childbirth. Following the analogy I gave above, even if you don’t save your child the psycho might turn around and stab you after killing your child. Also, more than half of women who underwent abortion experienced negative post abortion reactions. 28% attempted suicide, and 18% succeeded! Also, most of the women who underwent abortion expressed that they are ‘forced’ into abortions by pressure from family and friends. This is largely because people think that abortion would be good for the woman in question but is it? These people have never experienced abortion so who are they to exert such pressure on the pregnant woman?

I said that Mothers are the only one who have a choice that is the way the pro-abortion group wants it.

"5-7 days after fertilization, the blastula attaches to the wall of the uterus (endometrium). When it comes into contact with the endometrium it performs implantation. Implantation connections between the mother and the embryo will begin to form, including the umbilical cord" It is now an embryo not a blastocyst. note that in 5-7 days it is no longer a blastocyst and in this case most women don't even know they are pregnant because until it is an embryo they do not stop having a menstrual cycle. "Week 4-5 Chemicals produced by the embryo stop the woman's menstrual cycle. Neurogenesis is underway, showing brain activity at about the 6th week.[citation needed] The heart will begin to beat around the same time. Limb buds appear where the arms and legs will grow later.

Also, a lot of newer members came in since the last abortion debate. A new abortion debate will have plenty of fresh opinions on it.";3;0;2;Yes
3478;abortion;"The right to life is more important than the right to freedom of choice. If you were forced to strip a woman either of her freedom of choice in some specific matter, or her life, I bet you would choose the freedom of choice. Similarly, if you agree that fetuses are humans, then saving them takes precedence over preserving the woman's freedom of choice. You say you can't 'enforce your personal values' on others. Would you allow murder, then? Rape, pillage, theft? All of these involve personal values... where do you draw the line between enforceable and non-enforceable personal values?";3;0;2;Yes
3478;abortion;"-You ask what punishment to impose on abortionists. That's a tough question. I would prefer a mixture of retributive and reformative justice: the retribution could be through suitable fines or jail sentences, reformation could be through demonstrating to the women why abortion is wrong. I would mitigate the punishment on these women because most of them are not fully aware that they are killing humans. - "Banning it would only the make the practice more private." that's the case even with banning other crimes, such as theft, murder, etc. Although some abortions might go underground, some will stop. Since the US legalized urestricted abortion in 1973, there was a significant INCREASE in abortions. Moreover, in 1992, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey imposed certain restrictions on abortion, the number of abortions suddenly DROPPED. This supports my claim that banning abortions will reduce them to some extent. (for the numbers, see: http://www.euthanasia.com/usstat.html ) But even if banning abortions does not reduce them, don't we have a moral obligation to ban them anyway? - I agree that if the mother's and/or child's life is threatened, abortion is justified, since my whole argument is aimed at upholding the right to life! The second case (mercy killings) is more complex, and I'll just leave it for now. Since the majority of abortions aren't mercy killings, that topic is insignificant. - are you saying that men shouldn't stop murder because they don't bear the babies? Should we not try to stop slavery if we're not slave-owners?! Further, whoever proposes the argument is irrelevant to the quality of the argument itself. Even if the men have ulterior motives, as long as they're right that abortion is murder, they're right. Period.";3;0;2;Yes

If she feels that she does not want to raise, or is not capable to raise an infant, she should not participate in sexual activity, or if she is not willing to be abstinent, she should well educate her self on ways to have safe, non impregnating, sex. There can be pro choice in pro life. The woman always has a choice. BUT HER CHOICE IS TO NOT GET PREGNANT. What she doesn’t realize it that she is in control of being a murderer, or staying safe and never being faced with taking a life! If we can justify killing pre born babies, where do we draw the line!? Why not just kill the old or the cripled. While were at it lets just kill the people with cancer or a common cold...they are just an inconvenience, no one wanted them anyways. Its probably a mistake that they are here anyways....does that sound humane to you? Didn’t think so. So why is it acceptable to say it for someone who hasn’t had the chance to live.

From other religions it might be against your religion. but i still believe that it should be illegal. If you know you can't support your baby you should put it up for adoption. I also think that the government should be putting more money into adoption agencies and less into seniors. I know that seniors have been alive and been important to our lives, but we have to care more about the children. We have to care more about our future. If someone was raped or it was incest they should still have the baby, i mean it is still a live and it still a baby. well i believe that you should have used a condom and that she should have been on the pill otherwise dont do it at all if you don't want kids and aren't planning on it, because i think that you should avoid abortion anyway possible.

Since "fetus" is translated to "unborn child" I guess we have an unborn unborn child. Never hurts to throw the Latin around to avoid the reality of life in question. We would normally, as human rights activists, always err on the side of life and hence leave any question in favor of the child, but since that is incovenient to the sexual revolution we will make an exception. Here is the bottom line. Define life in such a way that gives you constitutional protection and denies that protection to an unborn child or "fetus" (whichever makes you more comfortable)";3;0;2;"Yes, Abortion is Unconsitutional."
83;abortion;"Okay a well written answer! Finally i get to work with something =]. 1) The Life inside the woman is a seperate organism, the mother is just the host. The DNA of the fetus has a different genetic make-up then the host mother. The mother is "nurturing" the fetus until it is born and still the mother takes care of it. In today's circumstance you can always give the child up for adoption etc. The most common claim that I here is that the fetus can't live outside the mother andf is defenseless. Well how about a child who is 1 week old. Left outside because its mother didn't want it? Pretty much the same result. But one is considered murder the other isn't? 2) The fetus begins to develop the instance it is concieved. The child begins to "feel" around the third week. Its brain and nervous system starting to grow fully araound the 4-5 week. Only one month out of nine. The fetus is not a lifeless blob. It develops over the course of the nine months and becomes a full organism. 3) No one said we had to bring religion into this. In fact its NOT a religious one, it is a legal one. Muder is murder, and thus if one commits said murder one shall be punished. But is abortion murder? Murder is defined has the unlawful killing of an individual or something outrageous and blameful. Abortion where it is not unlawful is something that today is frowned upon by many and is considered outrageous. 4) Your reference to castration of perverts... We are not forcing woman to stop getting impregnated. We are trying to secure the rights of the life that is growing inside the woman. The cell is the simplest form of life. The fetus is LIVING. So as you can see there are a lot of us who believe a law should be made, not because of moral issues, but by science and legal review, abortion is a form of murder.";3;0;2;"Government...ok to make laws that prohibits abortion"

It is impossible to tell that the birth will prove fatal to the mother until the actual time. I seriously can't believe there are people on this site or anywhere that would justify the murder of an innocent life but defend a homicidal maniac who's killed countless of individuals and say that his life is precious.

How do you determine universal anyway? I'm met people that don't think Mexican immigrants are human beings with rights. Is it acceptable for those people to kill Mexican immigrants since the recognition of their humanity isn't universal?

2532;abortion;"I'd like to respond to a lot of these comments: 1. What happens to those who practice it? The same thing that happens now to people who perform illegal procedures or murder (depending on how abortion was made illegal). 2. Law does not exist to 'teach' us that something is wrong. Law against abortion would exist to protect the lives of the babies, not to teach that abortion is wrong. 3.(a.) If you are actually protecting the life of the mother this would be a triage situation (although I very unsure how an abortion could be 'saving the ... child from death'). (b.) How could we possibly determine that a child in the Sudan would be better left unborn? It may be that child that suffer and starves that will grow up an change the situation in Sudan. 4. This is a fascinating statement. I've mostly heard woman (and most of them mothers) argue against abortion, not men. Aside from which, the validity of an argument is not really dependent on the source. We may question/test and argument more because of the source, but good arguments will stand. In short, your first 4 arguments give no support to your position because most, if not all, are non sequiturs. Now, your 3 points and following. We could say that the law has three possible solutions to murder (or theft, or rape, etc.): (1.) All people must murder. (2.) All people must not murder. (3.) People have the choice to murder. Does this mean that we should take position #3 because it's not the extreme view? You completely ignore the issue of whether or not the fetus is life. If the fetus is life, then abortion is just as much a political issue as murdering, rape, or theft. Abortion would be the infringement of the right to life of that fetus. Wouldn't taking that right be tantamount to acting pompously toward them? Note here, I'm not talking religiously, nor am I talking about the right of the mother. If the baby is alive, it has rights, and doesn't the government have the responsibility of protecting those rights? Okay, your last three points: 1. Like your first original statement, this is a non sequitur. Neither the punishment nor the relative success of a law are not the reasons for passing the law. The law wold be to protect human beings. 2. You do however, have the right to protect those who can't protect themselves. If you saw a man beating a child to death, I doubt we would find it acceptable if someone claimed, 'I didn't have the right to stop that guy from beating his kid.' 3. But what about those who have the experience? Besides which, this again ignores the issue of human rights. Do I have to own a slave to know that killing a slave is wrong? Finally, 'life is important, but Liberty is important as well.' Who protects the liberty of the child, if the fetus has life?";3;0;2;"Government...ok to make laws that prohibits abortion"
2532;abortion;"Actually many, many doctors in the medical field recognize the fetus as human. This is especially true after around week 8-9 (when brain waves typically initiate), or even earlier (such as when the heart beat starts usually week 5). Both of these happen well before the first trimester ends. Google it to learn more. Also many in the medical field view the embryo and/or zygote as human because of his/her genetic makeup. Either way, this means that the medical field does not 'universally' recognize that the fetus is not a human life, despite your claims. In fact, this supports my initial rebuttal.";3;0;2;"Government...ok to make laws that prohibits abortion"

136;abortion;"I'm not picking on you, but your comments are some of the very few in this debate worth reading. Everything else seems like a debate in my high school english class with a bunch of 16 year olds. Punishment: i doubt that a punishment for the actual would be mother would exist. If would most likely be the doctor's who would be punished. Most likely through a hefty fine or a stipping of their license. The "back alley docs" would, if caught, either be fined or go to jail for practicing medicine without a license. - Situation pending: Abortions due to rape, incest, and threatening of the mother's life are a statistical rarity. Any legislation passed because of this would be a rule for the exception. Why dont we let Sudan deal with their abortion laws and we'll deal with ours. But in terms of bringing an American baby into a world of poverty, one of the very few things i agree with Obama on are that there should be some sort of governmental child support. Its not fair and its illogical to force people to have a baby if they cant afford it. This does however, delve into the whole "being responsible" thing. - Men: I think men should have a lot more say in this than they do. Men dont have to be pregnant, they dont have to carry that baby around for 9 months, they dont go through the physical or emotional toll that pregnancy takes on mothers. But they do have to pay child support. Regardless of what the man wants, if the woman wants to have that kid, the man has to fork over the money. If you're going to say you are Pro-Choice, then it has to go both ways. Positions of Abortion: Why are those the official positions? THey arent correct and they paint an extremist picture. I think the two positions on abortion are the two major ones we have today. 1. Abortion should be left up to the mother, as it is her choice. 2. Abortion should be outlawed, as it is immoral to society. You're damn right Abortion is a moral issue. There is nothing political about it. Most of the people in this country think abortion is abhorrent. They, like yourself, find it to be "think it's sick and irresponsible".

Why should we do something because some people think its wrong according to their morals - that come from religion or they way they were grown up." Ok well first off, the moral opposition to abortion isnt based on religion..its based on flat unbiased moral sense. Second, remember what i said to Juggernaut. The American divide on this issue is about whether or not a woman should have the right to choose, not whether abortion is ok. No politician is Pro-Abortion, they are Pro-Choice. The reason for that is because no politician would get votes if they flat out said "Hi i'm running for president and i want you all to know that i'm perfectly cool with killing human babies, vote for me." They wouldnt get elected because the majority of Americans think abortion is wrong.

I think that one main benefit of keeping abortion illegal is that the girl will have to take responsibility for that baby - take responsibility for her previous actions, since there is no way to prevent her previous actions unless you're the parents - not even then, sometimes. Of course, this puts a major and serious burden (a life) in an extremely young mom's hands. The kid will maybe end up in an orphanage or foster home, but, at least, the girl may have learned.

136;abortion;"Its unusual for me to break my 4th grader-esque vow of silence when it comes to making rebuttals to you TeachMe, but i have to poke my head in right quick. Why is it that in Abortion debates no one seems to bring up the fact that the new mommy can almost always give her baby up for adoption to a family that will love it and care for it better than she could? And on the rare occaisions where adoption is brought up, people cry sexism and say its unfair to ask the new mommy to carry a baby around for 8ish months. I dont get it. Is there something terrible about giving a child up for adoption that i'm not getting? And i know that you havn't said this but in response to the random people who cry that its unfair to ask a woman to go through the physical strain that is pregnancy, the new mommy did choose to have sex. She made the choice to engage in vaginal intercourse and accept another man's seed. With that action and choice of hers, as with every choice, there are potential and inevitable consequences that go along with it. Am i supposed to feel pity for mommy who chose to engage in an activity that can have unwanted results? Correct me if i'm wrong, but i was always under the impression that the waiting list for US Adoptions is astoundingly long and that adopting a child from another nation like China is as expensive as purchasing a sports car. Why does adoption always get thrown under the rug? I understand that the "Pro-Life" movement has some sh*tty aspects to it. Most people, myself included, dont want other people telling them what to do. But Pro-Lifers aren't telling people what to do with their bodies because they enjoy having control over others, they do it because they think that life is sacred. While we can debate until kingdom come about what constiutes life, you cannot deny that aborting a fetus/baby is the destruction of potential life. Pro-Lifers, and myself included, are morally against doing that. I know this is probably a big unorganized mess and seems like i'm rambling, but its been a while since i last made a rebuttal to you so i'm a little rusty.

2808;abortion;"*doffs feathered cap* Thank ye, kindly, teachme. I thought it rather fitting, myself. : ) Oh, of course not. The man is also at fault - him knowingly having sex with a virgin and then running off with no intent to marry is also morally wrong. But the results of that action rest moreso on the woman - the woman has something more than a conscience that should maintain her behaviour - it's the possibility of both having a baby and of catching sexually transmitted disease. A woman should, morally, have no intimate sex (beyond the kiss) unless prepared to settle down and take responsibility for what might result of it with the man. It may be 'fun', but is it so fun when she does have the baby? I don't think so! She suddenly becomes extremely conscience of her actions and is forced to claim responsibility for them. If she could abort it, she could breathe easy - what kind of lesson would that be? She's gota an instigator that can pretty much reach up and slap her in the face. The man doesn't necessarily have this, but he will (maybe when he gets married) eventually regret his previous actions. Of course it would! The person responsible for any resulting possibility should maintain a careful life in order to prevent anything such as an unwanted baby to happen. People have sex and then the girl says, "Oh, i didn't know..." or "I didn't think it would happen to me". That's just it - if the person does think and take care, then there is no problem. "How about keeping our own population "in check"!? Do we really need anymore unwanted children in this world to adopt?" Ohhhh, so this is like China, eh? Aborting all children and impeding on individual rights that way. :P Abortionists claim that their rights have been infringed - I think it would work vice versa, too. Those who legitimately have children would be infringed this time. I would suggest that those with legitimate children have priority in rights. If we were to crack down like so, would legitimate people be happy? As I say, the moral and ethical implications are extremely large. If the lady is terminally ill or the baby is going to have a fatal disease upon birth, it might be better for the baby to end life before knowing it - miserably. The same with the woman - if she has no ability to care for it - no welcoming parents, even, that baby could well end up in the gutter. Yet, this matched with taking responsibility with previous sexual actions, or the soul and rights of the baby.... It creates a big mess in which we will never truly come to a decisive conclusion.

YOU could have been an aborted fetus- your life and what you've become would just not have come to exist. Secondly, although the "less unwanted children" thing makes sense, it's just not right to convert the value of life into statistics. One can logically assume that if there aere less people, ther is less crime. But you also can't ignore that alot of people started their lives as unwanted children, but still did great things with it. Thirdly, there are smarter and more humane solutions to the crime problem.

By three months (and often earlier) the baby has nerves (ie can feel pain), and it happens very often that an abortion takes place after the third month. As for your argument about not having sex being wrong because it denies a baby its right to life - there's a big difference, in the one, there IS a baby there already, in the second, there's only the possibility.

For the government not to take a side on the issue it must remain legal. If it were illegal the government would definetly be taking a side. The government has only two options: legal or illegal. Making it illegal is deciding for everyone that they cant have abortions. Making it legal is letting people make up their own minds.

Cows are just as sacred to Hindus as babies are to you, but you can't just force your own beliefs on other people." Are you sure about that? People do it all the time and they use the government to do it. Even in democratic countries. The majority of people in the United States believe it is wrong to steal under most circumstances. The government has enacted laws to prevent people from stealing and punishing them if they do. I'm sure there are a very SMALL minority of people who think stealing is ok. We, as the majority are forcing them to conform to OUR rules which are based on OUR belief systems. To say that we aren't able to force our beliefs on other people is to say that laws shouldn't exist. Laws are people forcing other people to conform to a certain set of morals, even ones they may disagree with. Is this wrong? I personally don't think so, but that's a whole other debate.

3853;abortion;"Not a bad point. But there are two different types of lwas: those that impose a set of beliefs, and those that uphold society. Certain laws are necessary to maintain an ordered society. You mentioned stealing, also murder, and just generally harming other people. These laws need to exist to protect citizens and for a society itself to exist. The other ones do not. Belief laws are not necessary for society to exist but exist because some people want to force their beliefs on other people. An example of this is gay marriage. We dont need to prevent gays from getting married in an effort to protect society, but to make this a more Christian society. Drugs, some people believe altered states of mind are bad so therefore nobody should use drugs, but again society would not crumble of people could legally smoke pot.

What we have to consider, however, is that the fetus is not able to function on its own while in the womb, during the early stages of pregnancy. It is therefore not truly an individual 'life' at the stage of development when abortions take place. The fetus is still very much a part of the woman's body...just like any other part of her body, really.

But consider this, if killing a baby one day after birth is murder, is one day after O.K.? I disagree. Giving birth itself may have been a choice or not but although small that zygote still has the right to live.

Schools can also tend to teach it to kids too young or use scare tactics about pregnancy and std's. Both of these tactics don't work as they give kids the wrong idea or the kids don't believe it and start having sex. Schools and churches should not teach kids about sex only the parents. i know it can be hard but with parents their learning sex from a person who has done it and probably has a normal opinion on it. I agree with you that they shouldn't teach sex religously because its just not right.

I think life does not startuntil the sperm and the egg cell combine and form a zygote, just depends on where you believe life begins. Also god is pro-life because one of the ten commandments is thou shalt not murder their neibor. And medically a fetus is alive as it breaths eats and its heart beats.

Not allowing abortion teaches more responsibility to kids. education can only help so much. and scare tactics usually don't work.( for instance my school said the odds of getting an STD from any sexual intercourse is 1 in 4, which obviosly is not true), i'm not saying its not a risk but not incredibly likely. When you make a mistake like having sex at too young an age and getting pregnant you need to have a consequence that you cannot get out of it. teen pregnancy will decrease once you take the option of abortion off the table. abortion is also like assisted suicide being legal. as you can see recently abortion has started taking that path. Legal turns into accepted accepted turns into funded funded turns into presssured pressured turns into Reqired to lower the population. anyways every wrong decision reqires a consequence that you cannot get out of. abortion is like putting someone in jail but give them the option of getting out. Of course not on that scale but in the same ballpark.

No It means LIFE can be tracked from the point of the beginning of the fetus. The following summary from the textbook Developmental Biology looks at all views, from Aristotle through theologians and scientists. Correctness can be found in all views making this not a pro choice/pro life question, but a scientific one with input from philosophers, theologians, scientists and other people that have studied this at length. The entire textbook is called Developmental Biology by Scott Gilbert and is used in reputable colleges as the textbook for future Doctors, Scientists, Researchers and modern day Philosophers. When Does Human Life Begin? This is a note that may generate some discussion and debate. It was occasioned by a bulletin board set up by a political action group at our college. The board claimed that while philosophy and religion may have different opinions concerning when life begins, science has no such problems. Students were told that biologists were unanimous in agreeing that life starts at fertilization, and that there was no dispute in the scientific literature. Besides being a parody of science (i.e., that scientific facts are the objective truth and that all scientists agree about what these facts mean), it is wrong. I have read a wide range of scientific positions on when life begins, and these positions depend on what aspect of life one privileges in such discussions. Here is my classification scheme concerning when human life begins. You may have others. * The metabolic view: There is no one point when life begins. The sperm cell and egg cell are as alive as any other organism. * The genetic view: A new individual is created at fertilization. This is when the genes from the two parents combine to form an individual with unique properties. * The embryological view: In humans, identical twinning can occur as late as day 12 pc. Such twinning produces two individuals with different lives. Even conjoined ("Siamese") twins can have different personalities. Thus, a single individuality is not fixed earlier than day 12. (In religious terms, the two individuals have different souls). Some medical texts consider the stages before this time as "pre-embryonic." This view is expressed by scientists such as Renfree (1982) and Grobstein (1988) and has been endorsed theologically by Ford (1988), Shannon and Wolter (1990), and McCormick (1991), among others. (Such a view would allow contraception, "morning-after" pills, and contragestational agents, but not abortion after two weeks.) * The neurological view: Our society has defined death as the loss of the cerebral EEG (electroencephalogram) pattern. Conversely, some scientists have thought that the acquisition of the human EEG (at about 27 weeks) should be defined as when a human life begins. This view has been put forth most concretely by Morowitz and Trefil (1992). (This view and the ones following would allow mid-trimester abortions). * The ecological/technological view: This view sees human life as beginning when it can exist separately from its maternal biological environment. The natural limit of viability occurs when the lungs mature, but technological advances can now enable a premature infant to survive at about 25 weeks gestation. (This is the view currently operating in many states. Once a fetus can be potentially independent, it cannot be aborted.) * The immunological view: This view sees human life as beginning when the organism recognizes the distinction between self and non-self. In humans, this occurs around the time of birth. * The integrated physiological view: This view sees human life as beginning when an individual has become independent of the mother and has its own functioning circulatory system, alimentary system, and respiratory system. This is the traditional birthday when the baby is born into the world and the umbilical cord is cut. Literature Cited Ford, N. M. 1988. When Did I Begin?

164;abortion;"I mostly ignore these abortion debates, but felt compelled to actually write a comment of substance, As much as pro lifers would like to make choice about fetus personhood they ignore the realities of womanhood. They ignore the fact that it takes 2 to tango, but one to suffer the consequences. They belittle the consequences and say things like “give it up for adoption” without considering the realities of things like job loss and education that are not inconvenient, but ruining in the long term. One of the most important factors in women's advancement in society has been their ability to control their fertility. More than any law, the ability for a woman to chose when to become pregnant has led to higher rates of education and employment success. Let me make this clear… when the Founding Fathers lived…. Abortion was LEGAL. Abortion did not become illegal until 1857. Before then midwives distributed herbs and root mixtures to cause abortion, then called “quickening”. The group? The AMA! A large part of this push for criminalization was an attempt to push midwives out of the market in order to open up more patients for doctors. The bases of their argument was not moral, but instead nativist. Look up Dr. Horatio R. Storer, the leader of the criminalization movement. He was a bigot who believed whites needed to outbreed natives, and he also included midwifery with native “uncivilization”. The AMA did not just fight for criminalization, but also abortion under special circumstances, thus, giving the male physician total control over who may have abortions, forcing midwives out of business and establishing a medical patriarchy. This continued through the 20th century with the institutionalization of health care which did nothing to stop abortion, but drove it underground. Through the 1950s and 1960s abortions became more difficult, more dangerous, and more expensive to obtain. This led to reform legislation long before Roe v. Wade. By 1967 12 states had already passed legislation. The battle for most of US history was not a moral one, but one of womens place in society, patient rights, and civil liberties. Some argue the cycle of child birth and rearing is a consequence for actions, personal responsibility bla bla bla, in other words I know enough to force my opinion on a decision I have not had to make, and for the guys, never will. When we say “consequences” we mean consequence, singular, for the woman, doubled in guilt through blame of questioning morality to be in the situation to begin with. In the words of Supreme Court justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter: "At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life." This is seen as immoral in our society by some, yet Viagra commercials are acceptable. We can debate about teaching abstinence in school, yet have no problem with erectile dysfunction drug companies handing out pens to our doctors. The best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy is through sexual education and ready access to contraceptives, two things many pro-life people are against. Even in a perfect society where we are educated, have ready access to contraceptives, unique and individual cases arise that must be looked at with an objective and clear eye each and every time. One thing is for sure, criminalization kills and does not prevent abortion. 43% of the worlds abortions are done illegally. Pro life people often demonize those who simply look at reality, the consequences from the past, and the idea that such a decision is for the individual not the state to make. They talk about baby killers, social engineering, insane conspiracy theories etc. I think –Planned Parenthood- says it best on their website, “If you are pregnant, you have options. If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption. Only you can decide what is best for you.” So you have three links, options, parenting, adoption, think that is the best summary of my side of the debate as possible.

As to your questions, all good ones by the way: 1. The State's answer: Tell them that rape is horrible, a vicious but cowardly act, should definitely be prosecuted. Explain (at their level) that there are many couple waiting for a child, that while they are too young to bring a child up, they are old enough to provide this gift of life. Also that they still have the choice to make, and whatever they choose you will assist, uphold and defend their decision. Therapy is also expected to happen during this time. 2. The State's answer: The same as # 1 3. Kids waiting for adoption are given hope , therapy and are placed hopefully in good homes while waiting. The real challenge is to connect adopting parents with them. Most people think they must have a new born, but are willing to listen to alternatives when they realize the cost of adopting a newborn. More attention needs to be paid on adopting other aged children. Public awareness and work done by public agencies, go a long way in assisting adoption agencies in getting that message out. More funds need to be allocated towards this end. 4. That conversation is solely between the mother, her physician and if she has one her spiritual leader. Whatever, her decision it must be honored by all. 5. There is truly more than enough love out there. What there is not enough of is funds, support, therapy and people willing to be involved. Adoption is VERY expensive no matter what the age of the child and newborns being the most expensive. Also some States have really whacky laws. For instance. In the State of Florida, You can be single, married, divorced or gay and be a foster parent. However, you must be married or have REALLY good connections to adopt these same children. Single, divorced are discouraged and find it harder, and gays cannot adopt at all. However, there are many families in these categories that are already successful foster parents. As for going through abortion and changing your mind, I don't think abortion plays that big of a part. Those that have undergone the procedure seem to understand what they went through and use it as a tool to move on better equipped. Those that use abortion as a method for birth control probably need some therapy, as the abortion is not the problem, the personal attitude about pregnancy, relationships and intercourse or intimacy need to be looked at. Allowing abortion as an alternative is a legal and viable one, as long as all other aspects have been looked at and addressed. I almost neglected to say: EDUCATION, EDUCATION, EDUCATION! This is the most basic answer. Working with pre-teens and teens, male and female, will get better results than any politician, physician, scientist, or arm chair quarter back will ever produce.

Many say that this is not "technically" murder, but I want to know what gives you the right to say that a fetus is not a human life. In my opinion, the minute the sperm and egg meet and the fetus is created is when a human life and a soul are created in that child. There is only one situation in which I think abortion is a necessary evil. When a woman is physically incapable of carrying the child that she conceives (as when an 8 year old is raped and cannot carry the child) this is the only situation in which abortion should be allowed. I believe that in this life, we are meant to suffer the consequences of our actions, therefore I believe that if a teenage girl conceives a child ( through consensual sex ) she should carry that child and give birth to that child and, at that point, she may choose whether keeping the child or putting him/her up for adoption is better FOR THE CHILD. This is my main point in all of this. What is best not for the mother, but for that innocent child, is what we should concentrate on in making all decisions during and after pregnancy and, if you choose to keep the child, throughout his/her life.

3689;abortion;"To answer this question, it is best to determine whether or not the fetus is actually alive when the abortion takes place before considering further details. Let us first take a step back from such a controversial issue and define "life" in a human adult. An adult coma patient, as an example, is regarded as "alive" if and only if he or she has a heartbeat, regardless of whether or not he or she could survive without the assistance of machinery. According to the Mayo Clinic, the heart begins to beat at five weeks. However, the Mayo Clinic numbers the weeks according to the start of the last period so that conception is regarded as having happened in week 2, thus the heartbeat begins during the 4th week after conception. This date is clearly within the range of the first trimester, a time frame which is generally considered acceptable for an abortion to take place. Of course, brain activity in the fetus does not begin until approximately twenty-five weeks after conception. However, if one considers brainwaves to be the defining of life in a human, then one may argue that the fetus is not alive. Before taking this defense be sure to consider coma patients with no brain activity--should they all be killed immediately even though there is evidence that they can come back and return to their lives? The two scenarios are not unrelated, and a stance in one requires a corresponding stance in the other. Alright, so now we have discussed the conditions of life. From this point on, I will operate under the most basic assumption--that the beating of the heart signifies a life and that the levels of brain activity cannot be a decisive measure. Now let us move on to some of the arguments common from the pro-choice side. First, that if the woman was not impregnated through a consensual act she should be permitted to abort the pregnancy and not have to carry the child of her attacker. While I pity in woman in this situation, we must be clear on the subject of to who's rights we are referring. The woman should have the right to move on from her attack yes, but this is a right based on compassion rather than morality or legality. The fetus should have the right to life--even if that life will be partially lived in foster care or with an adoptive family--which is a right based on both morality (lived and let live in its most literal sense) and legality (murder is a crime punishable by jail-time or even death). Second, that if the parents are teenagers they cannot be expected to care for a child and should terminate the pregnancy. Again, I acknowledge that this can be an immensely trying time, but, again, the ease of one or two people's lives does not trump the continuation of another. If the child truly cannot be kept by "too young parents," there still exist care options for parent-less children. Third, that the above is all well and good, but that child services cost taxpayers a ridiculous sum of money. In response, I can offer only the following: well then, people need to control their sex drive. Now, back to the immediate topic at hand: should abortions be legal? By my definition of life--the start of the heartbeat--the expecting woman has a four-week window in which she can get an abortion before the fetus is alive. It takes two weeks for a pregnancy to be able to be detected, so this woman has, at most, two weeks in which she should legally be allowed to get an abortion, this is assuming that she immediately begins checking for pregnancy, so it may actually be less of a window if any at all.";3;1;2;"i am against abortions"

3746;abortion;"All life on Earth was created, and it is therefore morally wrong to deprive an unborn child of its God given right to live. Even though it may not be fully formed, a fetus in the second trimester is still able to feel pain. Although the baby is still in the womb, it will have its organs early on, so even when you abort it in the first trimester, you are still killing a living thing, a human. ABORTION IS MURDER! And I'll bet if you asked an unborn fetus whether he fancies the idea of being murdered, it would tell you to at least wait until it was old enough to fight back. All life on Earth was created by the almighty God, and so it follows that only the creator should take it away. As unbelievable as this may sound, your hard earned taxes go toward keeping abortion clinics running. Rape may be an excuse for an abortion, but there are other options besides abortion. Rape is horrible. But why should the child pay for the wrong doing of another? The baby is innocent of the offense and his life need not be taken because of the act of another. Just because your baby is going to be born with some special needs does not mean you can terminate him before he is born. Give him a chance. Miracles happen. Think about it. What if YOU weren't living right now, because your mother decided to get an abortion?

So the question then becomes not whether it is the woman's right to do something with her body, but that given that she accepted the risk of pregnancy (except for rape) by engaging in sexual penetration, that her rights are not unlimited. They should be balanced against the interests of the unborn. We can argue the degree, but the principle stands.

So what? she's pouring out all her anger on the child because that was the son of a rapist? or because she wanted to get her life back together? dude her life will never be the same whether or not she gains a child.. It's not the baby's fault that he was created out of monstrosity. A mistake will never be corrected by doing another mistake. And just because abortions are performed all the time or are done regularly around the globe doesn't mean it is right. Try putting yourself in the situation of the child, would you ever want to be murdered by your own mom because you were unwanted? what if you're mother tried to abort you before but she didn't, how would you feel now? would you regret that you lived?

4296;abortion;"I don't think many people feel abortion shouldn't be an option for rape victims. My question, though, was why we inherently value that child as lesser (not legally but colloquially). I'm going to have to take issue with a few of the statements you've made as well. 1. While no hard numbers exist, it has recently become clear that partial-birth abortions (late term) is almost never required to ensure the women's safety. I'm talking .1% of abortions performed. 2. I'd ask this question--is there any 100% effective form of birth control? The last time I checked there was not, and so any person engaging in penetrative sexual behavior takes on the responsibility for potentially conceiving a child. 3. Abortions are surprisingly unsafe. This is not a reality that has been reported by the press because its existence would detract from many of so-called benefits to abortion. http://www.slate.com/id/2285988/. The article suggests that abortion can be a relatively safe procedure, but that the kinds of professionals performing the procedure (generally the least capable physicians) creates a situation where the danger is increased dramatically. 4. The child might not have the best life, but I would still think it would prefer a life. If the mother is that incapable a parent, she should just get her tubes tied. 5. Yes, contraceptive methods need to be better taught. However, I think they should be taught from the angle that having sex is not a zero-cost activity. By engaging in the practice, you take on the responsibility for the potential outcomes. You must be responsible. I'm going to start a battle on a similar abortion question if anyone is interested.";3;1;2;No

So why is the law, When you murder a living being, it's instant jail. But when you abort and literally murder a baby inside you thats OK?

Another argument is it is the womans right too choose, women may be able to validate her reasons for wanting an abortion but wheter you believe it to be right or wrong she is making a selfish choice to benefit herself and her current lifestyle with the majority of the reasons for wanting an abortion is simply that the woman is not ready to be tied down with a baby (but was ready to in have unprotected sex fully aware of the chance of pregnancy) Once the wheels are in motion for an abortion the medical agencies involved are obviously pro abortion and there is no inbetween agency to determine whether the woman is really happy with her decision this leads to many problems as the woman is not really making an educated decison with information from both sides, firstly there may be medical problems later on in life which can result in infertility, secondly the mental problems numerous women have suffered in later life due to abortions and thirdly the culture that abortion can be used as a form of contraception as alot of younger women are not fully aware of what is really being done other than that they just want the baby to be gone so they can go back to normal. I personally would not like to see abortion totally stopped as it would cause more problems than solving and to go back to the days when women tried to abort there own babies or did so illegally is not what anyone wants. But rules of abortion must be stricter an abortion can take place up to 6 months, which no matter what you believe is abborant and is murder.

Okay, if the woman has the right to choose, then so does the man. I do NOT mean by this that the man should be able to tell the woman she MUST or MUST NOT have an abortion. However, abortion is often the result of a woman not yet ready to be a mother. Okay, fine, but the man should have the same choice. On this particular point, the fact that he his not the pregnant one is irrelevant. The reason for the choice is the point.

You also say that biologically speaking, the unborn baby has miles to go before reaching the biological structure of a normal human being. That is true - but it is also true for babies & toddlers. A baby has approximately 300 bones, a full grown man around 270. A baby cannot say anything, nor see anything. A full grown man can.

It seems to me that your definition of 'living' means being able to live off on its own, without relying on anything. We rely on many things to survive, including food, water, oxygen, sleep, and the like. So does the unborn child.

I find the question of when human life begins central to the abortion debate, far superseding questions of ''privacy'' and the woman's right to self-determination. Take a fetus one day pre scheduled birth, while not out of the womb, I find it relatively uncontroversial that this viable fetus should not be afforded standard human rights. Walking it back, we eventually reach the point of partial viability, a couple months before birth, and still I think we should defer to the child rather than its mother. Going back further, we then reach no viability, not that this point isn't constantly regressing, but it seems a more reasonable proxy for human beginnings with the caveat that it would and should shift as prenatal technology becomes more robust.

4227;abortion;"So my question to you, is what is considered human? Someone that breathes, feels pain, can make voluntary movements, can hear, and see? If so, you are describing a fetus at 12 weeks.So I suppose under your train of thought that a partial birth abortion is ok as well considering the baby has not yet left the womb. It's amazing to me how pro-choice people can justify taking away the life of something just because you can't see it. Do you honestly think that a baby cannot think, or feel pain until it is outside of the womb? AMAZING! Before I was nothing, and now since I'm outside of a womb, I can do all of these things! Like magic! I guess the taking of a life is easy when you don't have to see it or do it yourself. Out of sight, out of mind. Did you know that most women who have abortions experience severe depression and feelings of guilt after the procedure? Your arguement at thispoint makes no sense. I've had surgery and never felt guilty about my tonsils taken away. Most people nor doctors for that matter would preform a surgery that would intentionally take the life of their patients. And why do you think doctors pay massive amounts of money each year for malpractice insurance? Because they ARE sued all the time for making mistakes and errors in judgement. And to your other arguement, babiees that are born premature very often grow up to have normal, healthy lives. So would it still be ok, if a mother were to go to have an abortion, only to have a premature baby and then kill it because she felt in wouldn't survive outside of the womb? This is a matter of choice. Unfortunately, because they cannot speak, an unborn child can't voice thier opinion. I'm sure given the options, they would choose not to die.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"I'm sure the baby doesn't decide . And it is their body that is being destroyed, not the mothers. And notice nobody mentions the fathers opinion. If a man wanted to be a father, where is his choice? I guess the mother makes that choice too. So lets see... Mother...all the choice... everybody else, 0. And let's flip the coin, if a mother has the child and the father desen't want it, he still has no choice but to pay child support. Once again , men have no choice in the matter. I'm starting to wonder if anyone is considering that this is a matter of life and death, or is this just a power struggle? It's my body, I'll do what I want with it! Ok then.... I guess you also believe that we should legalize heroin and PCP because it is your body you are ruining. And 4 year olds should get tattoos and drink whiskey because it is THEIR bodyot yours! Screw anybody elses opinons, thoughts, cares or wishes. Lets be selfish and think of nobody else but ourselves. Great idea.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"Fisrt of all, I never said talk... babies of course have not mastered any languages yet. My point is that a unborn baby (unless handicaped) can hear, feel ( nerve endings which include pain sensors which are developed by 9 weeks) are qualities of most humans which are already born. 2nd point... You may know what the concept of death is, but I'm sure you have no more idea what happens at death more than an unborn child. No, I do not remember what is what like in the womb. I also do not remember what being 9 months old is like... do you? Do you remember yor first drink of water? I'm sure you don't but just because you do not remember it doesen't mean it didn't happen or that if you were punched, you wouldn't have felt pain. Therefore , you cannot say with any proof that a fetus does not know it is being aborted. Check the science. If you have a nervous system, you can feel pain, whether or not you hear a scream, if you have active nerves, you feel pain. As for your arguement about not being able to handle the baby, I'm quite sure that many mothers could not handle the pressures of being a mother either emotionally, financially, or on a mature enough level. There are also thousands of families that cannot have children that would love to adopt, care for, and give the child a fullfilling life. As far as the doctors arguement , you have me a little lost. If a doctor makes a potentially fatal mistake during a routine operation, you feel that the patient or the patients family has no right to sue? Doctors make mistakes all the time, leaving surgical tools in people, leaving sponges in people causing infections, extreme pain, possible gangrene that can lead to death. I'm not sure of your arguement here.Please elaborate. Your final arguement disturbes me the most. Your arguement is that abortion should be allowd if the baby might be or is hadicaped, has HIV ( which by the way many people live relatively normal lives with ... medicine has come a long way) or any ther affliction that would not make them "normal" . I only know of one other person in history that set to destroy the handicapped, retarted, sickly, and "not normal". His name was Adolf Hitler. I personally believe that people that are handicaped , retarted, with Down's syndrome, are sick ,or have any disease have just as much right to a life as you and I. To think different in my opinion is a scary notion. Are you suggesting that a woman who is pregnant knowing that her baby has a disease should abort it? Take a look at Stephen Hawking. The man has MS and is considered by many to be the smartest man alive. Through him, we have learned much about the Universe we never knew before. Would we have done the world a favor if his mother knew he would have had MS later in life and aborted him? Look at what we would have missed out on. Albert Einstein has Asberger's Syndrome, a type of Autism... Should he have been aborted too because he wasn't "normal"?";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"You have made no counter arguement about what was mentioned about how a father has no say so in the life or death of his baby. Your previous arguement said that it is a womans body, therefore her choice.You also did not counter argue how the fact that the baby has no choice, and how it is ITS life that is being destroyed and not the mothers. You are absolutely right. I do not know you, and can only go by what you say. A blanketed statement ( that pro-choice people love to over use) is that its their body, their choice. This is all that you really wrote without going in depth. I never said that you believed in legalizing PCP or heroin, I said I guess you believe it should be legalized only because of the broad statement which amounted to it'sa womans body, none of your buisness. Since the war on drugs is supposedly because we do not want Americans dying from using drugs, and your standpoint was its our bodies, our buisness, it is a pretty easy conclusion that you feel that nobody should interfere with what you do to your own body, nobody should make something you do to yourself illegal. Maybe next time you should elaborate on what you mean. And I would love to hear your view on a Fathers role in the abortion issue. Since it took a male to make the baby, shouldn't they have rights as well?";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"Your playground toy sharing analogy leaves out the one extremely important part. You did not mention the flip side of the situation if the father doesen't want to keep the child and the mother does, he MUST still pay for it, or face possible jail time. He has no choice. I also think that if this was as simple as a matter of giving blood, there would not be as much controversy surrounding this topic. I believe that where the line is drawn in this particular debate, is what constitutes a life. In my opinion, something with a functioning brain and a beating heart constitutes life. Both of these features are present in the first trimester of pregnancy.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"So according to your definition, abortion would be ok 10 minutes or even a few seconds before a baby is born? Really? Even though this baby could survive outside of the womb, it is not life? Wow. So the difference in your opinion between abortion and murder could be a manner of a few minutes... I would be very interested in seeing how many other pro-choice advocates feel this way. And even though this pregnancy could not take place without a fathers sperm , he still has no rights whatsoever? Interesting. But the baby is outside of the mother, and now he still has no rights. Sounds like the baby and father get the bad end of the deal. This is starting to now even more than ever sound like a power trip than someones rights. Let me ask you this... Love to see your answer to this question. If a person kills a mother that is 8 months pregnant, should that person be charged with one murder or two?";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"I appreciate your honesty as much as I cannot wrap my mind around your logic. The question is not irrelevant at all. If the one of the major deciding factors is whether there is life or not, I find the question to be quite revelant. I hate to tell you, but many states ( including the one I live in ) will charge a person with two murders in the scenario I gave earlier. Thay being the case, it raises the question how one death can be considered murder, and another nothing more than a choice. Do you also feel that a baby that is just a few days away from birth would not be able to live outside the womb, or feel pain? I truly that even most pro-choice people would agree that partial birth abortions are out and out wrong. Let me ask yet another question. What is the difference between a baby 2 days from birth and a baby that is just born? How can you justify such a difference in law just because one is in a body and one is just out of one? There has to come a time when one must stop believing that it is just a matter of a mothers rights, and start considering the rights of a baby.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"How the hell did religion get brought into this? I'm pro-life and I'm not religious at all. You do not need to start stereotyping those that are pro-life to being religious. And I love how everybody is avoiding the fact that everyone on the pro-choice side is so worried about a womans rights, when there is no consideration to a baby's rights. Ask any gynocologist if there is a life in a woman who is 8 months pregnant , and they will say yes., There is a life in there. Life does not spontaneously begin when it is outside of a womb. But screw it right? It cant argue that it is a life. It cant tell you how it feels about being aborted. Makes it easier to make that decision when you don't have the person whos life being taken away can argue with you. According to some people here, a child has no rights until they see the light of day. Meaning that technically a woman should be able to take a life even while giving birth if that is her "decision". As long as it is not outside her body. All this in the name of "rights"? I think you confuse the word religion with the word morals. You don't have to have religion to have morals. So let's try an arguement without bringing religion into it.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"Wow. You really never cease to amaze me. I have never met a hard-core pro -choice advocate such as yourself before. Some mentally disabled people cannot make independent choices for themselves. Their mother might have to make all of their decisions for them. Should the mother have the right to snuff them out as well? What if a woman is on her way to have an abortion, and has the baby on the way there. Since it was her body and her intention to abort, should she still have the right to take the life? If the baby that is born has a debilitating disease and must need constant care from the mother, but could live with her care, should she have the right to kill it then? Where is the end to your "woman's rights"? When does a baby's rights begin? Do you honestly feel that a baby who is minutes away from being born cannot feel the pain from being aborted as much as one that was just born being killed?? Or does the thought that you don't have to look at it or hear it make it ok?";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"I find it quite disturbing that you would correlate an animal such as a cow with a human. I am a naturalist and love all living creatures. I would like to know where you got your information on the number of pro-lifers being vegetarians or not. I bet if you were to take a poll, you would see just as many pro- choice advocates eat as much steak and chicken as pro-life people. Kind of an odd thing to bring up in a debate really. As far as birth control, other than abortion, the pill, condoms, diaphrams, ect. prevent fertilization from ever taking place. This is where your arguement is flawed. Kinda hard to abort something that never took place isn't it? This debate is about abortion, not birth control. That is unless you see abortion as a form of birth control, which would be another debate. I have clearly defined what I define as life and not a potential for life. Debate what I'm saying, not what you think other pro-life people are saying. I'm right here. Debate me. I also find your comment about killing an unborn baby Better than killing an animal quite offensive. One can say that you are more radical that pro-lifers by being such an animal activist. I wonder how you would feel about aborting unborn animal fetuses as a form of birth control. As far as a baby having an undeveloped brain and unable to have a memory. you might want to do more research. As far as them not remembering the pain of being aborted, you are absolutely right. They can't remember the pain..... because they were ABORTED.";3;0;2;No

4227;abortion;"Would you want to remove your limbs for reasons like gangrene ( medically deemed necessary), or just because you think it looks cool? If you are doing it for cosmetic purposes only, most doctors would not perform the surgery until you have been psychologically evaluated first. I don't think people having abortions are required to go to a psychiatrist first, but from what I have researched many do afterwards for feelings of guilt. Either way, it is none of my concern nor my buisness what you do with your own limbs. They belong to you and only you. There is no questioning that. Aggravate a miscarriage? I believe this person would need to be psychologically evaluated as to why they would purposefully miscarry if they can legally have an abortion. As far as the morning after pill, I don't believe there is a test that can detect pregnancy as quickly as the day after intercourse. IYou can't really know if you are terminating if you do not know for sure so I have no problem with the morning after pill. Your question about fetuses with anencephaly is a good one. I have read on this quite a bit, and to be completly honest , I do not have a die hard opinion on this. I would certainly not feel the same about a woman who terminates a baby that has no chance of survival, and without a fully developed brain , as opposed to a woman who looks at abortion as a form of birth control. The reason I brought up and repeated my stance on the "pain inflicted" is because the person I was debating with before felt that partial birth abortions were fine, and that aborrtions were fine even up until the moment of birth ( an abortion at 9 months). I think that even most pro-choice advocates would find this reasoning appalling.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"Martin Luther King and John Lennon stood for peace, togetherness, and a brotherhood of mankind.It's a Woman's Choice while being repeated by pro-abortionisits to the point that it sounds robotic as if there is nothing more to add is used alot, can hardly compare it to King or Lennon. King and Lennon didn't feel the need to repeat it. They got their mesage across the first time. So yes, explain it more, or pickanother quote by someone more relevant to the subject... Say Dr. Mengele or Jack Kavorkian, both doctors of death. I pose the question to you, are youglad YOUR mother didn't choose abortion? After all, if she had, the pro-abotionists would have one less person to repeat their anthem. I noticed that nobody has touched the subject of partial birth abortions as I believe even most pro- abortionists stay clear of this subject. If there wasn't a dead baby coming out of a womb, it would only be a matter of it being a womans choice. However, seeing that abortion is by definition the termination of pregnancy, there is more than one life involved. I would recomend that you watch a film from the 80's entitled "The silent scream". It can be found on youtube. Clearly there is life in a womb. Taking an innocent persons life is called homicide or murder. You can try to justify and make yourself feel better by calling it a matter of one persons rights over anothers, but when you see the evidence, it is a legalized form of homicide. By the way, attempting to take your own life is illegal. How about a woman that wants to take her own life? Should that be legalized as well? After all it is HER body.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"Attempting suicide is in fact illegal in America. Suicide itself is not because it cannot be punished. Remember Dr. Jack Kavorkian and his arrests for aiding patients in suicide? The patient had to push the buttons themselves to give the fatal dose of medication, but he was still arrested for just aiding them. If a woman attempts suicide and fails, she has broken the law, and she will get herself a trip to the local mental facility for observation, therapy, and questioning whether she wants it or not. So yes, "it's their bodies " doesen't hold up for me very well because the states recognize exceptions, which therefore makes the whole "It's their bodies" arguement moot. If we truly had total rights of what we do to our bodies, there would be no madatory trip to the nuthouse. I really would enjoy someone else chiming in on the partial birth debate. I'm not mad at all. I have not insulted you any more than you have insulted me. Your 4 word arguement has not trumped my arguement in the least as I have just proved with the example I gave of a woman not having her choice to take her own life. I'm honestly not trying to have you give up. I like debating which is why I came to this site in the first place. The reason I may seem to be hostile is because I don't believe an arguement can really be summed up and won with one sentence. Especially if that one sentence does not hold true in every way, shape, or fashion.";3;0;2;No
4227;abortion;"If we were talking about just her life affected by her own decision say a tattoo or a body piercing, I would agree with you entirely. The difference is that there is another life at stake, and unfortunately with no voice of it's own. As I mentioned in a my previous post, It is impossible to prosecute the dead. Kevorkian did give the peoples to kill themselves, but the people ultimately made the decision and pressed the proverbial button that ended their own lives. There is in fact a mandatory evaluation by a psychiatrist if a police officer witnesses someone trying to kill themslves. A woman pregnant woman would never stand over my shoulder and tell me what to do because I can never carry a life in my body as they do, so I'm not really understanding your point. I don know that with today's laws, a woman CAN decide for me if I am going to be a father or not, and if I am, I will potentially be paying child support for 18 years. So in this regard, Yes, a pregnant woman can stand over my shoulder and tell me what I will be doing for the next 18 years. It's not so simple that it is her body. If it were just her body( see tattoo example) , I would agree with you. A baby isn't a blob until the day it is born. It grows into a body. Remember.

However, nobody told that too this innocent, unborn child who tried to flee from its death even as pieces of it were sucked away. The sin of a parent does not transfer to the child.

5701;abortion;"Hahaha. Having a baby is not like magic. There is a process undergone in order to have a baby. They wouldn't have done it by accident would they? If they committed the mistake of having one, that's something they'll regret and shouldn't run away from. Let's take into considerlation the fact that the baby they'll have would just end up experiencing an awful life. By the time that they're made 'carelessly' is already awful. Ask some orphans, they'd probably be happy above anything else when they're with their parents. So of course, abortion should NEVER be legal.";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
5629;abortion;"Legalizing abortion would be a mistake for ethically speaking terminating life in the womb would hinder the baby's right to life and if we see it carefully whether it is planned or unplanned pregnancy, does the child have fault to be the one suffering the consequences of wrong decision making? doesn't it make abortion murder? killing the innocent child instead of using contraception? how can you say that abortion is legal. Yes we give the autonomy for the mother to choose whether to undergo abortion but we must consider the principle of stewardship or the responsibility to care for ourselves and never do destructive things and in this case abortion is destructive for it will involve manipulation of the body in septic ways for it is illegal thus stewardship is violated thus having to choose whether to legalize abortion or not I stand that we must not legalized abortion for 2 ethical principles are violated rather than violating only 1 principle of ethics is violated when we don't legalize abortion thus ABORTION must not be LEGALIZED...";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"

5707;abortion;"What difference is there between the lives of a one-day old child and an eighty-year-old man? They are both of equal value, that is, a value beyond the murderous hands of any other man or woman. Then by the same token what difference is there between the lives of an unborn baby and a born baby?

You have no more (and no less) right to live than someone else, for example a fetus. How would you feel if someone told you "sorry man, Earth has too many people. Go die."? As for there's "a pretty good chance of the mom or the baby or even both dying anyway", that is just sheer absurdity. Maternal death rates in the US in 2008 was 24 per 100 thousand mothers (Source: CIA World Factbook). Do you think that is "a pretty good chance"?";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"

394;abortion;"The debate comes down to the problem of consent. I'd sugest it doesn't matter how you answer "is the foetus a person" question - philosophers look at that but in making law we must first look to practicallity. There is too much liklihood that we are wrong when assuming either that they are or are not human, therefore lawmakers must err cautiously. As what we are killing may or may not be a person, and we can't be sure, the moral qualities are that of risking a person's life. The liberty of the woman to control her body is forgone as the more important right to life is in danger.";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
4227;abortion;"I would like to know how the pro- abortionists feel about this scenario. A pregnant woman is on her way to get an abortion, along the way she becomes a victim of a shooting, killing her unborn child. Since the woman was going to abort this baby using " her choice" anyway, should the shooter get convicted of just the actual shooting and not for the murder of the unborn? Should a Judge not have a say so in the sentencing because it was " her body"The end result was the same, the removal of an unwanted baby. I'd also like to know how people who are pro-abortion feel about people who are mentally retarted or have Down's Syndrome, since many people abort their babies because they are afflicted with these conditions... Is their life worth less than a healthy "normal" person?";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
394;abortion;"I would agree with you that the choice as to the morality remains largely subjective, and a variety of different opinions can be taken as valuable, however I would suggest that it is still right to legislate on the matter. You refer to the birth mother's choice and command over her own body, and from there it follows that she be the deciding authority on what happens. This is the case, justly, in most law, however it ceases to be the case when the mother is not the only interested party. One cannot kill to save one'self if the person you kill is not the aggressor. Here we see a distinction - when our choices as to out own bodies deprive other's of their own autonomy. A baby/foetus cannot be seen as an aggressor - so they have all the moral qualities of a bystander, inadvertently effecting a mother's body. We then have the problem of whether or not we can consider the baby as having the right not be unjustly killed. They are incapable of forming an opinion on the matter, and the birth mother has a conflict of interests. There is no one who can judge competently whether the child has the right to stay, which would curtail the mother's rights over her body. The law is justified in preventing us from doing wrong to others, and is it not justified in curtailing one choice because it may do direct harm to others? The law cannot consider any of the relevant agents to be qualified to make the decision, so the action must be averted, due to the fallibility of the actor and the risks of her being wrong.";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
394;abortion;"Surley you will agree that the law cannot appoint a guardian for an almost-person? And if they could, the guardian would always have to advocate on behalf of not killing the person. A court cannot rule the end of a person's life without (in the USA and other such jurisdictions) a) proof of guilt of a capital crime, or (in cases of patients who wont wake up) b) them being essentially dead already. In the case of abortion the child is not guilty of any action, and not only is there a chance they will `wake up`, but independent of intervention or bad luck, we fully expect them to. So would you not agree that the law cannot justifiably permit the death of an innocent person who will wake up. And thus permitting it where there is a question of personhood, to rule the death of a party who may or may not have personhood has the same characteristics as ruling death without proof of guilt or their not waking up.";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
4227;abortion;"I'm still waiting for a response to my last post about the baby being killed on its way to its own abortion. As far as choice, the Father has no choice. It does take two to make the child, but it,d life is decided by one. Another debater said that the court takes the Fathers opinion into consideration. I wonder how many documented times that the Fathers opinion changed a ruling. I'm thinking ot many if any at all. Another point on choice. we live in a society that will arrest you if you are caught with drugs, even if the intent was for personal use. Would these people that are so concerned about a womans choice also stand up and say that the government should legailize hard drugs because they have no right as to what goes in her body?";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
5643;abortion;"i dont think someone could go on after killing something that will be a child. you can always put the baby up for adoption then at least you could know that they have a good home and have a sense of what they are doing. and you could still have a chance to go back and fix a mistake after abortion its done";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
4227;abortion;"As with most situations, things must be looked at on a case by case basis. As far as your question about miscarage, I believe that a woman who did not have any intentions on aborting her baby would be suffering enough by having a miscarriage. Unless it is an extreme case, you would have a hard time proving intent for miscarage.Abortion is deliberate miscarage.As far as legallities, I honestly think you would have a better chance winning a lawsuit against your roommate for giving you lung cancer because he/she smoked in the house than you would legally pursuing a woman for having a miscarriage. I hope that answers your question. I wouls appreciate a respone to my question that I posted earlier about a pro-choice persons feelings on a woman being shot on her way to an abortion. Should the shooter be charged for homicide if the baby would be terminated regardless? Also had a question regarding a pro-choice persos feelings about legalizing drugs sice its our own bodies we would be harming. Shouldn't they be legal and we can make our own choices?";3;1;2;"Abortion should not be legal"
