you are a doctor. Two mothers come in, seperately. Both ask for your choice on an abortion. You feel the weight of a life on your shoulders. it goes on like this, giving the backgrounds of the mothers. Then it poses the statement:
should you decide to abort either one, you may have robbed the world the beautiful mind of leonardo da vinci or the cruelty of adolf hitler.

1855,abortion,"While this debate is made more palatable when said to be based on a disagreement between choice (democracy) or the lack there of (fascism) - I beg those on either side of the line to at least be honest with each other.
If one holds firm to a belief stating that life begins at conception, any act which eliminates said life is by definition murderous and therefore wrong. Regardless of the reason of the life's inception, it is a life and no human being has a right to extinguish an innocent.
If one does not believe that life begins at conception than they are able to 'choose' whether it is to be allowed (legal) or prohibited (illegal).
So the debate should center on when life begins; allow those who believe it to begin post conception to bicker on the morality of abortion.

we don't have the choice to murder people without consequence. this is no different.
people need to accept the consequences of their actions. you have sex and don't use protection, you pay the price. if you truly feel that you are not able to raise and care for a child, there is always the option of adoption. i was adopted. i thank my lucky stars everyday that my mom made the smart choice. just put yourself in that position. just considerer for five minutes that the possibility that you might not be alive. its a scary thought, isn't it?

In the case of abortion, we tell ourselves that since the baby has not yet fully developed into the recognizable human form, that it's technically not a human being. Therefore, it's not murder to end its existence. Following this line of thought, an apple seed is not technically an edible apple, so destroying a farmer's stock of seed is not immoral, since we are not ridding him of the final product he sells. Yet, it's pretty clear you're robbing him of his livelihood, regardless of how you phrase it. Just because a fetus is not fully formed does not mean it is not a human.",3,1,Pro-Life

828,abortion,"Alright, let's break this down if we can.
1. Outside of rape or the 1% where a condom/birth control fails, women do have the right to choose not to have unprotected sex.
1a. For those who argue that people make mistakes and they shouldn't be forced to have a child and to raise them I want to mention 2 points, 1. there is adoption, and 2. Other simple mistakes such as driving home drunk and hitting somebody, pulling a trigger and not realizing the gun was loaded...and of course there are more. In these cases the person is still held accountable and has to pay for their actions, why shouldn't a woman who gets pregnant due to lack of protection?
2. Psychological Trauma - others here have mentioned that it is wrong to force a young girl to go through the trauma and pain of having a child for 9 months. Well I think both sides can provide cases where a woman has psychological trauma either due to having the child or aborting the child, so this point is null for both sides.
3. Finally, for those that think that since it is the woman's body and nobody can tell her what to do, then I ask this question, what is the difference between a baby seconds after delivery and second before delivery? Nobody would ever allow somebody to kill a baby seconds after delivery because it wasn't convenient, couldn't be afforded, etc. So why when there is no physical difference for the child is it allowed to be aborted?
Ultimately, I feel that abortion is wrong and the only exception to that is women who are raped. I still feel it is wrong at that point, but I have personally seen what a rape can do to a woman and I would never try to tell them they have to be reminded on a daily basis of that horrible moment in their life. Outside of that, sex is a mature activity that should only be practiced if people understand the potential consequences (STDs, pregnancy, etc.)",3,1,Pro-Life

The flaw in this metaphor is that an apple seed is not intelligent, not unique, not capable of thought or emotion. Whether the seed becomes an apple affects only whether Joe Schmoe in Wisconsin will drink juice in the morning, not whether the world and history will be changed through its actions or whether its personal experience will validate its existence.

1866,abortion,"I'll answer your question. Life begins at conception, but not because of religion, but because of science.
At conception, the embryo is chromosomally complete which is to say that it has all the constituent parts that are required for growth and maturation. All that is required are the same things that we all require:
Food, oxygen, water and shelter.
The only difference is the means by which the child can obtain them.
To say that since it cannot get them by his/herself, the child isn't 'alive' is to also say that since a parapalegic can't get food/water/oxygen/shelter for his/herself, they're not alive either. Christopher Reeve after his accident wasn't able to get any of these by himself, but no one would claim that he wasn't 'alive'.

This argument assumes that the unborn aren't human beings because we all recognize that we can't kill innocent human beings solely because they aren't wanted.",3,1,Pro-Life
1842,abortion,"I found this:
Using the term "person" is another way that pro-choicers avoid admitting that abortion is wrong. Many pro-choicers will readily admit that the unborn are human beings or living members of the human species but will then assert that the unborn aren't persons and because of this it should be legal to kill them.
"Person" is a loaded word. Which means that for any number of pro-choicers, the term "person" could have the same number of different definitions. Make sure you ask, "What's the difference between a human being and a human person?"
At first, a good number of people aren't going to have an exact criteria for human personhood. This is because they haven't actually thought about it and are just repeating what they've heard or read from various pro-choice organizations. If they don't know right away, give them plenty of time and then ask them, "Isn't it odd that you're discriminating against the unborn because they supposedly aren't persons, yet you don't even have an answer for what makes a human being into a person."
Many pro-choicers will say that viability, the unborn's ability to survive outside the womb, is what makes a human being into a person. Others will say that mental processes such as self-awareness or the ability to reason is what matters. In the past, others used to say it was the color of your skin, your race, or your gender made you a "person" or was the deciding factor with regards to your rights. Unfortunately in recent history the term "person" and other terms like it such as "citizen" have been used almost exclusively to rationalize the enslavement, mistreatment or killing of other human beings.
It's what our country did with slaves. It's what Nazi Germany did with Jews. It's what many countries did and still do with women.
Any qualifications that disqualify unborn children from the arbitrary realm of human personhood, such as self-awareness, consciousness, ability to survive on their own, etc. will also disqualify other human beings like infants, people in reversible comas, those on respirators, etc. The fact is that all of these different definitions and categories for personhood are wholly arbitrary with no basis in fact or logic. Pro-choicers should have a very hard time convincing anyone why we should accept their arbitrary definitions of personhood and not the arbitrary definitions of the racist or sexist. Why should these qualifications be accepted instead of other arbitrary qualifications like height, weight, IQ, skin color, and gender?
Can't think of a good reason? Neither can they.
Pro-choicer will also use circular arguments to try to defend their arbitrary criteria saying, "the unborn aren't persons because they can't live outside the womb."
You can ask, Why should I accept this criteria for personhood?
"Because the ability to live outside the womb makes someone a person."
They'll unfortunately forget that a newborn couldn't survive outside the womb if no one was there to feed or clothe the child.
Pro-choicers will also use criteria that eliminates other human beings they consider persons like newborns or people with severe mental disabilities. Their criteria will at times also make certain animals into persons.
For example, some pro-choicers say self-awareness, consciousness, or the ability to reason are what makes us persons. Guess what? Infants aren't self-aware until about 3 months while many animals like dogs, apes, dolphins, etc. can form conscious memories and are aware of themselves, others and how they interact with the world around them.
So are these animals "persons" while the human infants aren't? If these animals are "persons" should we free these animal "persons" from zoos and give them the unalienable rights they deserve?
Other pro-choicers will continually change their definition of "personhood" if you point out how their criteria eliminates newborns and includes animals. They'll then begin to conform their definition of "personhood" so that only the unborn fit into the non-personhood category. At that point, you can say, "Isn't it obvious that your criteria for "personhood" is wholly arbitrary? You're simply using the word 'personhood' and changing its definition as a way to discriminate against the unborn."
Anyone can come up with a definition of "personhood." There is no reason why anyone should accept the definitions brought forth by the pro-choice movement.

1857,abortion,"An embryo, unlike an unfertilized egg, has its DNA. As long as you believe that your DNA is indeed your "blueprint for life", there is an enormous difference. Unfertilized- it really is just a cell. But once the two join, a new, entirely different entity is created, separate from both sperm and egg. From here, no matter how big the changes seem, the embryo simply grows and develops... just like every other human being throughout his or her entire lifetime.
As for many of the other arguments, including the lack of response and the fact that the embryo lives off of the mother...
Let me give you a similar example:
Think of a person in a hospital- unconsious (for now) and hooked up to a ventilator because he can't breathe on his own. (Keep in mind also that the chance of this person waking up and "getting better" in a few months is quite, if not very, good)
Do you have the right to kill this sick person simply because he cannot, at this point, function on his own? Of course not! Instead, the right thing to do is to continue caring for him and nurse him back to health.
The same is true for this embryo. He too needs a few months of care before he can go out on his own. I'm sorry, but that doesn't make you a parasite... and its nothing like being a clump of cancerous cells. It's simply being human.
(By the way... its not like all pro-LIFE people are men who will never have to go through pregnancy... I happen to be female.
As another side note: I have no problem with abortion ONLY IF the mother's life is really in danger... because then I'm still pro-life, only I'm looking out for the mother)",3,1,Pro-Life
1842,abortion,"I am in so many debates my head is spinning. So I will address only two of your comments. But first, Thank you for your honesty. It is refreshing to hear someone admit that they have changed their position. I know I didn't "win" you over, but your honesty is appreciated.
one:
YOU SAID:
A final thought: criminalizing abortion doesn't stop it. It just makes it beyond regulation. History bears this out as fact: remember the stories of knitting needles, coat hangers, back-alley butchers charging $300 without anaesthetic? The best thing you can do, whichever side of the debate you're on, is to support education about birth control and make it as readily available to people as possible.
RE:
This argument might be a good argument if the unborn weren't human beings and if legal abortion was a good thing but that's exactly what pro-choicers are trying to prove. Would anyone ever argue, "Thieves will be forced into dangerous armed robberies if they aren't allowed to pickpocket legally." This argument also says that because some women might break a law prohibiting abortion that abortion should be legal. Pretty much every law is broken. Should we repeal these laws too?
Two:
You Said:
Constitutionally, a human being's charter rights and patrimony begin at birth. Isn't that a clear definition? I mention it for rhetorical purposes only.
Re:
I submit that the subject of abortion is bigger than lawful definitions and goes to the heart of mankind's morality.That is speaking to the "Feelings" or inherent morality of mankind but many people need facts.
Here is what I found:
Human Embryology, 3rd ed.
Bradley M. Patten, (New York: McGraw Hill, 1968), 43.
"It is the penetration of the ovum by a spermatozoan and resultant mingling of the nuclear material each brings to the union that constitues the culmination of the process of fertilization and marks the initiation of the life of a new individual."
Biological Principles and Modern Practice of Obstetrics
J.P. Greenhill and E.A. Friedman, (Philadelphia: W.B. Sanders, 1974), 17.
"The zygote thus formed represents the beginning of a new life."
Pathology of the Fetus and the Infant, 3d ed.
E.L. Potter and J.M. Craig, (Chicago: Year Book Medical Publishers, 1975), vii.
"Every time a sperm cell and ovum unite a new being is created which is alive and will continue to live unless its death is brought about by some specific condition."
In addition to the consistent testimony found in medical textbooks, there is some equally conclusive evidence that exists on the public record. In 1981, a United States Senate judiciary subcommittee received the following testimony from a collection of medical experts (Subcommittee on Separation of Powers to Senate Judiciary Committee S-158, Report, 97th Congress, 1st Session, 1981):
Professor Micheline Matthews-Roth
Harvard University Medical School
"It is incorrect to say that biological data cannot be decisive...It is scientifically correct to say that an individual human life begins at conception."
Dr. Alfred M. Bongioanni
Professor of Pediatrics and Obstetrics, University of Pennsylvania
"I have learned from my earliest medical education that human life begins at the time of conception."
Dr. Jerome LeJeune
Professor of Genetics, University of Descartes
"After fertilization has taken place a new human being has come into being. [It] is no longer a matter of taste or opinion...it is plain experimental evidence. Each individual has a very neat beginning, at conception."
Professor Hymie Gordon
Mayo Clinic
"By all the criteria of modern molecular biology, life is present from the moment of conception."
Dr. Watson A. Bowes
University of Colorado Medical School
"The beginning of a single human life is from a biological point of view a simple and straightforward matter – the beginning is conception."
The official Senate report reached this conclusion:
Physicians, biologists, and other scientists agree that conception marks the beginning of the life of a human being - a being that is alive and is a member of the human species. There is overwhelming agreement on this point in countless medical, biological, and scientific writings.
This, of course, should come as no surprise since the American Medical Association (AMA) declared as far back as 1857 (referenced in the Roe. v. Wade opinion) that "the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being” is a matter of objective science. They deplored the “popular ignorance...that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.” Doctors knew it during the 1800's and doctors know it today. Human life begins at conception.",3,1,Pro-Life

If your answer is because abortion takes the life of a human being, then something does not seem logical.

1867,abortion,"eithout going into details of the arguments etc. and or whether or not i support legislagtion one way or the other, I would like to point out something here.
The crux of the issue is when life begins.
Everyone agrees that once a baby is born, killing it is murder.
Everyone agrees that one is (legally) allowed to remove a part of their body which is not a seperate living entity. i.e. thier left pinkie.
And everyone agrees that the government should not be allowed to legalize murder.
However, due to the fact that babies develop from a part of a body (i.e. ovum) into a seperate living body (i.e. a baby) there is contention of where the point of life begins.
You have : from conception; from second trimster; from fully developed fetus; from partial emergence; from majority/head emergence; from cutting cord; and finally from cutting the cord.
Now being this is not something that we can determine scientifically because what life means to some is deifferent to others, and even if we were to determine one to being the scientific begining of life, life is not neccessarily determined by biological or even concsious/psyche factors.
However, we do need to legally define life for various reasons, one of which is abortion.
The fact that religious people hold that abortion is murder is a moot point. It is a philosophical argument in the first place (as stated) and therefore one philosophy is not necessarily more correct than the other.
Therefore their argument against abortion is simply saying that the government should not allow murder. And it is a compelling argument.
In fact, it is EQUALLY as compelling as the pro-choice argument that life begins at breath.
They are both based on the persons own and private philosophies and beliefs.
So if the government were to vhoose any side of the argument, it would be the government IMPOSING their interpretation AND beliefs on the people.
If they allow abortion, it is imposing the legalization of murder on those who believe that it is,
If they ban abortion, it is invading the privacy of those people that believe that the feutus is not yet living,
Its a catch 22,
and as much as you argue each way: the side points; statistics, hangers etc, arguments are moot in the face of murder.
And the imposition of religious beliefs is not a point either, for it is a debate which is a debate of beliefs in the first place, and either side is a belief.

Or a person in the hospital? What contribution do you require from the bedridden that will deem them human?
You might have to wait even longer for a terminally sick person to offer up a contribution than for a developing fetus which will soon be a joy-eliciting child.

1873,abortion,"Then can a woman decide to destroy her childs body?",3,1,Pro-Life
1858,abortion,"The issue of abortion is tricky in many ways. Pro-life supporters will use religion, claim that life begins at conception, and generally have a fit about any sort of abortion which they see as murder of the developing fetus. However, pro-choice supporters don't want to hear anything the other side has to say, they claim that what a woman does with her body is her own business, they say religion has no place in the debate, and they are generally close minded about the issue. To tell the truth, I used to be a big time supporter of the pro-choice movement. I followed along with the standard arguments, and I thought that it was overbearing for the government to tell a woman what she could and couldn't do with her body. I've since changed my thought process quite a bit. I now am a pro-life supporter, and here are my reasons and my thinking on the issue. This does not mean that I am right, or that I have the final or absolute correct view point on the issue, this is simply my opinion. First, let me say that I do support abortion when the woman's life is clearly in danger, or when she has been raped and is far too traumatized to carry the child, and her trauma will ultimately affect the child's quality of life. I would also consider abortion when a couple knows that their child will be so severely mentally handicapped that they will never live a meaningful life. However, I do not support abortions of convenience. There are ample methods of contraception available, from condoms to birth control pills to diaphragms, and these methods are widely available at relatively low prices. There is even the morning after pill if you have an accident, which I support as long as it's taken within the time frame (I think this is around 72 hours, but I'm not absolutely sure). Next, I feel that we have to hold society accountable for the choices they make. It isn't fair to allow a woman to say, "well sure, I was having sex, which I knew could result in pregnancy, but this baby is simply going to be a nuisance to me, I think I'll just abort the pregnancy and forget about it." I used to try to objectify the fetus and turn it into an object, but the fact still remains that we are talking about a child, not a piece of garbage. Only ONE PERCENT of abortions happen because of rape or incest, only SIX PERCENT of abortions happen because of medical reasons, 93 PERCENT of abortions happen for social reasons (for example, because the child was unwanted, or the child would ruin the mother's life). By week six at the latest, a baby's heart has began to beat, and blood is actively circulating in the body. Now, outside the womb, if someone willingly took actions to stop another person's heart from beating we would call them murderers, but if the "person" if you will, happens to still be inside the womb then it's fair game, and we can do what we please guilt free. 52% of all abortions occur before the 9th week of pregnancy, 25% happen between the 9th & 10th week, 12% happen between the 11th and 12th week, 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week, 4% happen between the 16th & 20th week, and 1% of all abortions (16,450/yr.) happen after the 20th week of pregnancy. I will admit that the majority of abortions do occur before the ninth week of pregnancy, but the heart is beating by the sixth week. If the abortion takes place after the sixth week, then it should be considered as an invasive action that deliberately stopped the heart beat and further development of what could have otherwise been a healthy and viable pregnancy. By week eleven, the baby is officially described as a fetus, and according to the statistics, 12 percent of abortions happen between the eleventh and twelfth weeks of pregnancy. Enough about the stages of development, let's look at contraception use in those who choose to have an abortion. Here's a statistic: Fifty-four percent of women who have abortions had used a contraceptive method (usually the condom or the pill) during the month they became pregnant. Among those women, 76% of pill users and 49% of condom users report having used their method inconsistently, while 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users report correct use. 76% of pill users who have an abortion report that they used birth control inconsistently during the month that they became pregnant, and 49% of condom users reported that they used condoms inconsistently during the month that they became pregnant. This relates back to the responsibility. If you are not responsible enough to consistently use a method of birth control, and you choose to have sex, then you shouldn't be allowed to simply throw your pregnancy away because it is inconvenient at the time. Now, only 13% of pill users and 14% of condom users who were regularly using their birth control method became pregnant. This is sill a high number, but is much lower than the previous numbers. This also relates to responsibility. You chose to have sex, and you decided to use protection; good for you, you made a semi-responsible decision. However, you knew that there was no 100 percent protection, besides abstinence, and you still had sex. You have to accept the consequences of your actions and behave like an adult. Let's look at it this way, we allow women to abort their unborn children because they see them as inconveniences, obstacles, or unwanted additions that have come too soon. What happens when a woman has a child, thinking she is ready, and decides that it is unwanted, has come too soon, or is to much of a burden? Do we allow a woman to kill her toddler, child, or teenager just because it proves to be too much? I think not. What's the difference? Proponents of abortion say that abortion really isn't murder because the fetus isn't viable and able to live outside the womb at the time of the abortion, but this isn't always the case. And even if it were the case, and every woman aborted her pregnancy before the fetus was viable, it still doesn't change the fact that, somewhere down the road, the fetus would have most likely come to term and been a healthy, and very much alive, baby. My alternative, carry the child, experience the labor and delivery, and then if you still can't stand the inconvenience of the child YOU CONCEIVED THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, give the baby up for adoption. THERE ARE PLENTY OF COUPLES WHO ARE UNABLE TO CONCEIVE IN THE US WHO WOULD LOVE TO ADOPT THE CHILD THAT YOU WERE GOING TO ABORT AND THROW IN SOME MEDICAL WASTE CONTAINER.",3,1,Pro-Life
1858,abortion,"You say that religion and personal beliefs shouldn't be an argument when thinking about abortion. But isn't your whole argument a personal belief? You believe that women should be allowed to have an abortion, and should have control of their bodies. This is a completely personal belief. Someone on the other side, someone such as myself, believes that women shouldn't be allowed to abort a pregnancy for convenience, I agree that this is an argument about beliefs. If you take the factors of religion and personal beliefs out, then you don't have a basis for argument. You feel that it isn't immoral for a woman to have an abortion, and you believe that the government should agree with you and grant women this right. However, this isn't a right that all women will take advantage of, such as voting was, and it isn't a right that all women support. When women weren't allowed to vote, that was an issue that had nothing to do with beliefs. It was simply immoral to allow women to have a say in who governed a country that they lived in, and pretty much every woman was on board with the idea. What you are suggesting, abortion, is an issue that some women don't even support, and morals and personal beliefs can never be removed from the argument. Furthermore, the argument can never really be won because we all define the beginning of life differently, and there is no concrete way to describe something so abstract. Therefore we have no grounds to make an objective argument, and everything anyone says will be subjective, no matter how slightly so.",3,1,Pro-Life
1408,abortion,"It is absurd and immoral to murder an innocent human being. The common pro-choice argument is against the humanity of the child. However, this is also absurd. What defines a human being? Quite simply, a living organism with the DNA of a Homo sapiens. An unborn child, not matter how far along, fulfills all three criteria.
- An Unborn Child Is Alive -
Biologically, there are three criteria for life. These are as follows: To be alive, something must (1) be able to reproduce on its own, either sexually or asexually, either through mitosis or meiosis, (2) be able to sense and react to its surroundings, on a cellular or macroscopic level, and (3) be able to consume energy from its surroundings for sustenance, on a cellular or macroscopic level.
A child fulfills all of these conditions at conception. A fertilized egg can (1) divide by mitosis, (2) exhibit irritability, and (3) consume chemicals from the placenta. Thus, an unborn child is alive.
- An Unborn Child Is An Organism (As Opposed to A Body Part) -
What distinguishes an organism from a constituent of another organism? It be able to sustain the conditions of life separately from another organism, and must have different DNA. Both of these are satisfied in a fertilized egg. We all know that an embryo has different DNA than its mother. In addition, at conception, the child is capable of surviving in an environment separate from its mother. In pregnancy, it is possible for a child to die and the mother live, and vice versa. Thus, an unborn child is an independent organism.
- An Unborn Child Has Homo Sapiens DNA -
This is pretty indisputable. The mother DNA is human, and the father DNA is human, thus the embryo has human DNA.
Since an unborn child is alive, is an independent organism, and has human DNA, it must be a human being. As a human, killing it without justification is murder. Since an unborn child is still innocent, as it has never done anything wrong, killing it is unjustified. Thus, killing an unborn child is murder. If murder is wrong, then, so is abortion.",3,1,Pro-Life

It was the man who raped her who did evil, and in return caused her to take action and have an abortion. In your example, they both made the decision to consent to sex and that always comes with reprocussions... whether you use protection or not. Condoms don't protect your heart, for example. But to get rid of the child like that.... it's sad. Its not the baby's fault, and there are always better options like adoption. Its sad that things like this happen! I know a woman who had an abortion many years ago and she has regretted the decision her whole life. She is a persistent pro-life volunteer at the Women's Resource Center and everything now!

Everyone always begin to give specific examples of reasons for abortions, such as rape. Here are some statistics for you. Over 95% of abortions are because of birth control, such as not affording the child, getting in the way of their job, too young, want to wait, etc. Only 1% have an abortion because of rape, 1% because of fetal disabilities, and 3% because of mother's help problems. By giving the excuse of rape, we are allowing 95% of all the women to have an abortion just because they don't want the child. In my opinion, you make the decision of having a child at the bed.
I understand it must be hard to bear a child after rape, which is still only 1% of all abortions. But don't punish the child for his/her father's crime.

1865,abortion,"The main question that the whole debate is dependent upon is not that of who gets to choose, but what the unborn is. If the unborn is not human, than no evidence for the pro-life case is needed. If the unborn IS human, than no evidence for the pro-choice case is adequate. If the unborn isn't a human, than the pro-life movement has no ground to stand on, and the other way around. Now to answer that question, the unborn IS human. In order to prove this I will use two separate, but equally sufficient arguments. The Law of Biogenesis states that living things reproduce after their own kind, therefore human parents must reproduce human offspring. How would it be possible to have a nonhuman offspring from two human parents according to the Law of Biogenesis? The next argument begins with this question: Is a newborn a human? Some people like Peter Singer may say no, but the general population will say that a newborn is a human. From this we can say that there are only four differences between the newborn baby and the unborn fetus. These four differences are size, level of development, environment, and degree of dependency. Beginning with size, how does size determine the humanity of a fetus? Is a large person more human than a small person? Is Lebron James more human than Sarah Palin simply because he is larger? Next is level of development. A four year old girl doesn't have a functioning reproductive system, does that make her less human than an 18 year old woman? A 10 year old boy has a less developed brain, but that does not make him less human than a grown man. So how does the level of development matter to the determination of humanity? Next is environment. You change your environment nearly every minute. You are reading this on your computer now, tonight you will be in your bedroom, and tomorrow you will be at work. Does being at your computer make you less human than being at work? Environment is an invalid factor in deciding humanity as well. Last is degree of dependency. Many people are living on oxygen tanks, dialysis, food tubes, insulin, and inhalers. These do not make anybody less human, so it wouldn't be okay to kill them. The same applies to the fetus. The ability to be independent completely of anyone or anything is completely impossible, therefore nobody would be a human if we used this to decide.",3,1,Pro-Life

422,abortion,"This may sound absurd, at first reading. Yet, I might be swayed by the argument, provided the following caveat is upheld:
No person ought to be FORCED to voluntarily put their life on the line for the sake of another person.
Every moment of pregnancy is risky - and a pregnancy (however naural) can and does, at any given time, endanger the life of the potential mother. At times, as in the case of a blood-pressure-rise induced annurism, this happens so rapidly, no measure can save the life of either the mother, nor the potential baby.
Alternately, a pregnancy can indeed have life-long, crippling effects on a woman. While I value human life, I value ALL human life, that of the potential child (it is not legally one until the moment of birth), as well as that of the mother.
I propose that IF a woman chooses NOT to host a foetus within her body (and subject herself to the real dangers associated with this), nobody has the right to interfere with her decision.
At the same time, I would argue that killing the foetus would be equally as wrong as killing the mother. Instead, the foetus should be removed from the womb when the potential mother no longer wishes to host it. It should be, at this point, afforded all the medical treatment available to other humans. If it is viable (or, if you prefer the term, if God wills it), the foetus will survive and can be adopted into a loving family. If not, then it will die.
That is not murder. That is not abortion. It is God's will/natural selection. Yet it also does not interfere with a woman's right to control her own body.
So, why abuse the woman, making her carry the foetus for 40 weeks agains her will and likely suffer ill affects from it, then let some family bond with the child for 5 years, then asked a half-formed human to make a life-and death decision?
It would seem much better to preserve each individuals rights! Do not , ever, interfere with a person's right of self-determination. Yet, do not make a decision to kill, either.

The flaw is that, the difference between an unborn child and a 6 year old is simple: the law. So there is a higher authority involved. Roe vs Wade set in place laws which governed the time of viability, which is reached once 28 weeks of pregnancy come about.
That being said, there are people out there (crazies), who believe it is morally A OK to euthanize children up to the age of 6 using the reasoning of viability. According to them children have NOT reached viability yet, because they still depend upon you for the basic needs of life. A pretty horrible belief, but one held by some, in my opinion too many.

Nobody would be choosing between killing anyone....and if God wills it, the foetus will survive. That is not making a choice between the life and death of two individuals: to the contrary.

If the foetus really IS advanced enough to survive as an individual (or, if you wish, if God wills it), it will survive.

Wade) that "the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being” is a matter of objective science.

I’ve researched quite a bit on abortion. I was partially pro choice at first but after all I’ve read I’m totally pro life now.
Pro choice people’s main argument is that women should have a right to choose. But then they overlook the fetus! Shouldn’t the fetus have a right to choose as well? Pro choice would mean ending a life just because of potential risks, while pro life preserves a life in the presence of potential risks. Analogy: Your child is going to be stabbed by a psycho. If you save him you run the risk of being attacked by the psycho, but if you don’t your child will definitely die. What do you do then? Isn’t it obvious?
Also, a lot of pro choice people do not believe that fetus should be considered a life (so that they don’t have rights).They find it easier to just disregard the fetus because it doesn’t exactly look human yet. But it is scientifically proven that the heart of a fetus starts being 20 days after conception and brainwaves are given off at 40 days. If heartbeat and brainwaves are not considered signs of life, then all humans are not alive, we all shouldn’t have rights.
Another main basis of pro choice argument is that pregnancy is risky for women. However, it is proven that abortion is four times deadlier than childbirth. Following the analogy I gave above, even if you don’t save your child the psycho might turn around and stab you after killing your child. Also, more than half of women who underwent abortion experienced negative post abortion reactions. 28% attempted suicide, and 18% succeeded! Also, most of the women who underwent abortion expressed that they are ‘forced’ into abortions by pressure from family and friends. This is largely because people think that abortion would be good for the woman in question but is it? These people have never experienced abortion so who are they to exert such pressure on the pregnant woman?

There is no 180. You simply had no reasonable argument so you through that in there.

the pro-abortion group wants it. You are the ones who want the choice for yourselves the choice for mothers to make to kill there own child. No choice for fathers.

"Yes, the court CAN decide if there is a custody dispute.

1% of all abortions occur because of rape or incest; 6% of abortions occur because of potential health problems regarding either the mother or child, and 93% of all abortions occur for social reasons (i.e. the child is unwanted or inconvenient)."
"At what gestational ages are abortions performed:
52% of all abortions occur before the 9th week of pregnancy, 25% happen between the 9th & 10th week, 12% happen between the 11th and 12th week, 6% happen between the 13th & 15th week, 4% happen between the 16th & 20th week, and 1% of all abortions (16,450/yr.) happen after the 20th week of pregnancy."
"5-7 days after fertilization, the blastula attaches to the wall of the uterus (endometrium). When it comes into contact with the endometrium it performs implantation. Implantation connections between the mother and the embryo will begin to form, including the umbilical cord"
It is now an embryo not a blastocyst. note that in 5-7 days it is no longer a blastocyst and in this case most women don't even know they are pregnant because until it is an embryo they do not stop having a menstrual cycle.
"Week 4-5 Chemicals produced by the embryo stop the woman's menstrual cycle. Neurogenesis is underway, showing brain activity at about the 6th week.[citation needed] The heart will begin to beat around the same time. Limb buds appear where the arms and legs will grow later. Organogenesis begins. The head represents about one half of the embryo's axial length, and more than half of the embryo's mass. The brain develops into five areas, along with vertebra and bones beginning to form. The heart starts to beat and blood starts to flow."
Still well within the first trimester and it is obvious it is a life form and not a blastocyst.

- Banning it would only make the practice more private, and it would not teach people that abortion is wrong. It'll teach them that getting caught aborting is wrong.
- It truly depends on the situation. If aborting the baby would mean saving the mother and/or child from death, then it should be the mother's choice. Also, if the child would be born in an area where it would starve or suffer, the fetus would be best left unborn.

3320,abortion,"No, saving the fetus does not take precedence over the woman's rights. The woman, being a developed human being, has more rights than the fetus, given that the fetus has not yet developed into a full human (as in a stage where it's ready or near ready to be born). The embryo and the early stages of the fetus have the potential to become a developed human being, but aren't yet so. Therefore, I don't think an embryo or early fetus should get the same legal standing as the woman, who's body is what allows this fetus to develop into a ready-to-be-born baby.
In response to your second paragraph, let me ask you something. Do you think any of the women getting abortions would favor allowing murder? Would they wish to allow rape, pillage or theft? Obviously not! These values you've mentioned are shared by almost everyone living in our society--these are shared values, with absolutely no controversy surrounding them.
Is preventing a fetus from reaching a fully developed stage the same as going up to a stranger on the street and shooting him in the face? Do you think most women revel in the decision to get an abortion?

3320,abortion,"Even though the post I'm responding to was for Juggernaut, there's one point I'd like to address.
In this post, you say that when the U.S. authorized unrestricted abortions in 1973, there was a significant increase. Yes, there was an increase, from 16.3 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 that year, to 29.3 per 1,000 in 1981. What you failed to mention was that abortions leveled off and began dropping that year at a steady pace. Abortions didn't suddenly drop in 1992, as they'd already been decreasing at an even more increased pace since 1990. The Planned Parenthood v. Casey restrictions don't appear to have had an affect on the already-declining abortion rate, according to the graph here:

IF you AGREE that fetuses are human!
Of course, most of the world's population DOES NOT agree with this (I cannot locate my old sociology textbook to give you a specific reference, but I am sure you can find independent sources).
Why?
Because it is not an adult, who had earned the full rights we accord humans.
In our society, we regard 'children' to be 'human' from the point of birth - that is the legal definition. Yet, we still do not give newborns equal rights, privileges and choices to those we give to adults.
I am not making a value judgement, simply stating a fact: even in our own 'Western' society, where children are given greater value than in ANY other society in history, we do NOT give them rights which are identical to those of adults.
Why?

96,abortion,"There are three positions to abortion:
1 - All pregnant women must have an abortion, by law
2 - All pregnant women must not have an abortion, by law.
3 - All pregnant women are free to choose which they prefer.
My position is #3. The only non-extremist position out of the three.
I'm not left-winged or right-winged, I like to consider myself full-fledged.
Abortion really isn't a political issue, it's more of a religious/moral one. And religious bias is never a good thing to show in bias. I used to think the U.S. opposed the favoring of one religion over another, but then I realized the constitution is only a peice of paper.
I oppose animal hunting, animal cruelty because of my religious/moral beliefs, but I am not pompous to the point where I would want people to lose their rights.
Taking away people's rights usually opens up a bad can of worms. Ask any oppressive leader you know.
Also, I would like to make the following points:
1 - What should the punishment be for practicing abortion? Nothing. The bigger the punishment, the more private the practice will be. That's why prohibition never worked and never will work. Also, you can't expect people to pay a fine for aborting their own body parts. If life was really sacred, you wouldn't be advocating to put a dollar sign on dead fetuses or take away the rights of the living.
2 - I oppose abortion. I think it's sick and irresponsible. Though, I don't have the right to force anybody to abort or not abort. Neither do you.
3 - So, you would still force the woman to carry out their pregnancy if it would threaten both her life and the child's life?
4 - You lack experience and knowledge to decide whether abortion should be illegal. Once you experience carrying a fetus, then you can make a fully informed decision.",3,1,No
3320,abortion,"The baby is the only one in the situation who deserves a choice? So the the embryo or the earlier stage of the fetus is somehow supposed to make a decision on whether or not it wants to be born? The funny thing is, I actually agree with you that the woman should know better than to let herself get pregnant; she should most certainly use protection during sex. The best way to lower the abortion rate is through increased sex education in all public schools--programs that teach both abstinence and safe sex (condoms, birth control pills, etc.), not through banning or restricting the practice of abortion. As I've clearly demonstrated in one of my above posts, restrictions on abortion haven't had any visible effect whatsoever on the abortion rate, which has been steadily declining completely on its own. More robust sex ed programs should help decrease it even further. To use a tired but true phrase: "safe, legal, rare".",3,1,No

If that had happened, you're 100% correct, who would you be having this conversation with? Not me! And I wouldn't be alive to care in the first place. So what's the issue?
You make another point that's all too easy to rebut. Your quote: "i just dont get how anyone thinks that it is their say to who lives and who doesnt." My response: That's how we all came into existence to begin with! Our parents one day decided to create us--or, in some cases, a pregnancy was created unintentionally and the parent or parents of the currently living person-in-question made the decision to let him or her develop into a human. The whole point of reproduction is that the parents decide whether or not to procreate.
For your last point: "its the same as murder. we shun that by society. why is this ok!?"
How is abortion the same as murder? Once again, scroll up and read some of my earlier posts, you'll see that I've described how murder cannot be compared with abortion.

I thought this was a free country? I know how some people think, abortion is the same thing as murder, but think about the baby, growing up with a teenage mother who is poor and does not know how to take care of her child properly. Or maybe, the child has a disability that does not allow her to walk or see, or maybe has a diformed body. When she grows up, life will be torture, she will be teased, and she won't live a life worth living, and if she wanted to die, she had to die in pain. Whereas when you die as a baby, you do not feel it. A prime example we have seen recently is Nadia Suleyman, or "Octo-mom" who has 14 kids and is jobless, she has no way to support her babies, no money whatsoever. These 14 kids, might not survive. Why make them born and make them feel pain, while you can let them go and make them not feel pain it is better then growing up living a horible life. And also, sometimes, people get raped, think about the distress. A 14 year old girl gets raped and she is FORCED to keep the baby, she will lose her friends, stop going to school, and cannot live life like a normal teenager. What did ever do wrong? An abortion is better, so she can lead a normal life.

- Banning it would only make the practice more private, and it would not teach people that abortion is wrong. It'll teach them that getting caught aborting is wrong.
- It truly depends on the situation. If aborting the baby would mean saving the mother and/or child from death, then it should be the mother's choice. Also, if the child would be born in an area where it would starve or suffer (Sudan), the fetus would be best left unborn.
- Pro-life is usually an argument made by men who want to firm their control on women. If you aren't carrying any babies, who should you be to decide this. This doesn't apply to you. It's like having children decide what adult benefits should be.

Thanks Frankie for mentioning the rarities. Indeed many abortions are mainly because the "condom broke" or unprotected sex to begin with and yes there are always exceptions such as rape or liofe threatening birth, but that doesn't erase the majority of cases.
And again thank you Frankie. Many women that I know are actually pro-life. But many men I know are pro-life as well including me. But its always the women who get the say in it, even though part of me helps make up the genes of the developing fetus. It should be a mutual agreement.

422,abortion,"As in most 'abortion' debates, I would like to suggest a compromise.
Abortion is the intentional killing of a foetus, then waiting for the woman's body to rid itself of it. Frankly, I do not like the idea of killing - human or potential human.
However, it has been shown throughout history that 'forced childbearing' has been used to enslave women in so many societies, it is abhorrent and must never be allowed. In addition, being pregnant is a very risky physical state, physically and mentally, and nobody ought ever be forced to take such risks against their will.
So, what is the compromise?
Deliver the unborn child!
The moment a woman refuses to host a foetus, it ought to be removed from her body. That is the only protection for women everywhere from unspeakable emotional and physical enslavement.
However, there is no need to actually kill the foetus.
Medical advances are allowing younger and younger premies to survive. Once a foetus is delivered live, it has all the protections of a human being. At this point, all efforts to raise it and find an adoptive family for it can begin.
Thus, a woman will NOT have the right to choose to kill her potential baby. Yet, she will not be forced to host it, either.
It will then be in the hands of God (and science) whether the fledling with full human rights lives or dies. If this is done during the first trimester, chances for survival are slim. Yet, second-trimester delivered babies have lived....and third trimester almost assures survival.

That "animals are not ours to eat, wear, perform experiments on, or use for entertainment.".....you might agree with some but you wouldn't exactly appreciate if they passed a law that restricted all that PETA roots for.
Like I said...if you believe something stick to it but don't try to conform everyone to it because thats what you believe in. Those are your morals!!! Every person has a sense of wrong and right and being from a different country could also contribute to it...what one person might deem bad another might not.

From other religions it might be against your religion.

3799,abortion,"This is my personal take on it: Murder is a legal term, defined as the unlawful killing of one person by another, especially with premeditated malice. Abortion is legal, and even when it wasn't (between the late 19th century and 1973, or up to the late 60's depending on which state you lived in), it was never considered the moral or legal equivalent of murder. Occasionally an incompetent practitioner whose patient died after a botched abortion might have faced prosecution, but the women themselves seldom, if ever did. And it was never completely illegal, just restricted, as in having to be performed by a physician, and there were almost always exceptions for threats to the woman's life or health (which many conscientious physicians interpreted to include her mental health, i.e. threat of suicide), pregnancies caused by rape or incest, and fetal deformities.
A lot of people have things that they think are, or at least are as bad as, murder. Some people think capital punishment is murder. Others describe killing animals in order to rob them of their coats, use their meat, test them in laboratories, etc. as murder. But until either the law or the dictionary changes, calling something "murder" that clearly doesn't fulfill the criteria for murder is doing nothing more then trying to re-define words to promote your own agenda, and to stir up the basest of emotions in others. Sad things is that once a person hears "abortion is murder" often enough to believe it, it's only a matter of time before an unbalanced individual decides, "If you think it's murder, ACT like it's murder," with the resulting clinic violence we're all too familiar with.
More on what does and does not meet the criteria for murder:
Murder-n. the killing of a human being by a sane person, with intent, malice aforethought (prior intention to kill the particular victim or anyone who gets in the way) and with no legal excuse or authority. In those clear circumstances, this is first degree murder. By statute, many states consider a killing in which there is torture, movement of the person before the killing (kidnapping) or the death of a police officer or prison guard, or it was as an incident to another crime (as during a hold-up or rape), to be first degree murder, with or without premeditation and with malice presumed. Second degree murder is such a killing without premeditation, as in the heat of passion or in a sudden quarrel or fight. Malice in second degree murder may be implied from a death due to the reckless lack of concern for the life of others (such as firing a gun into a crowd or bashing someone with any deadly weapon). Depending on the circumstances and state laws, murder in the first or second degree may be chargeable to a person who did not actually kill, but was involved in a crime with a partner who actually did the killing or someone died as the result of the crime. Example: In a liquor store stick-up in which the clerk shoots back at the hold-up man and kills a bystander, the armed robber can be convicted of at least second degree murder. A charge of murder requires that the victim must die within a year of the attack. Death of an unborn child who is "quick" (fetus is moving) can be murder, provided there was premeditation, malice and no legal authority. Thus, abortion is not murder under the law. Example: Jack Violent shoots his pregnant girlfriend, killing the fetus. Manslaughter, both voluntary and involuntary, lacks the element of malice aforethought.",3,1,Pro-Choice

I won't get into my views on the father's position in this because it is outside the dabate.
I am tolerant enough to allow the mother the chance to let the lump of life be killed off before it becomes a human, and if you want to call it infanticide, then you are merely trying to use words that will drum up the feelings in people that you want (anger towards pro-choicers, shock at the idea of killing a child) then you aren't producing a proper argument, just trying to sway people to your side by the use of emotion, not rationalism.",3,1,Pro-Choice

Also, where does killing a baby end and wasting sperm cells begin? If you have sex, and then have an abortion, it's killing a baby. If you masturbate, is it murder? You're wasting thousands of sperm cells, one of which could have formed a life. Where is the line drawn?",3,1,Pro-Choice

Abortion is a very complex issue. The Moral and ethical implications involve can span on forever. I think that one main benefit of keeping abortion illegal is that the girl will have to take responsibility for that baby - take responsibility for her previous actions, since there is no way to prevent her previous actions unless you're the parents - not even then, sometimes.
Of course, this puts a major and serious burden (a life) in an extremely young mom's hands. The kid will maybe end up in an orphanage or foster home, but, at least, the girl may have learned. Also, if she does keep the baby (despite the tremendous responsibility), she will eventally grow attached to it and love it - something her boyfriend who ran off never actually did for her.",3,1,"No, it should not be allowed."

Why is it that in Abortion debates no one seems to bring up the fact that the new mommy can almost always give her baby up for adoption to a family that will love it and care for it better than she could? And on the rare occaisions where adoption is brought up, people cry sexism and say its unfair to ask the new mommy to carry a baby around for 8ish months. I dont get it. Is there something terrible about giving a child up for adoption that i'm not getting? And i know that you havn't said this but in response to the random people who cry that its unfair to ask a woman to go through the physical strain that is pregnancy, the new mommy did choose to have sex. She made the choice to engage in vaginal intercourse and accept another man's seed. With that action and choice of hers, as with every choice, there are potential and inevitable consequences that go along with it. Am i supposed to feel pity for mommy who chose to engage in an activity that can have unwanted results?
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i was always under the impression that the waiting list for US Adoptions is astoundingly long and that adopting a child from another nation like China is as expensive as purchasing a sports car. Why does adoption always get thrown under the rug?
I understand that the "Pro-Life" movement has some sh*tty aspects to it. Most people, myself included, dont want other people telling them what to do. But Pro-Lifers aren't telling people what to do with their bodies because they enjoy having control over others, they do it because they think that life is sacred. While we can debate until kingdom come about what constiutes life, you cannot deny that aborting a fetus/baby is the destruction of potential life. Pro-Lifers, and myself included, are morally against doing that.

Oh, of course not. The man is also at fault - him knowingly having sex with a virgin and then running off with no intent to marry is also morally wrong. But the results of that action rest moreso on the woman - the woman has something more than a conscience that should maintain her behaviour - it's the possibility of both having a baby and of catching sexually transmitted disease.
A woman should, morally, have no intimate sex (beyond the kiss) unless prepared to settle down and take responsibility for what might result of it with the man. It may be 'fun', but is it so fun when she does have the baby? I don't think so! She suddenly becomes extremely conscience of her actions and is forced to claim responsibility for them. If she could abort it, she could breathe easy - what kind of lesson would that be? She's gota an instigator that can pretty much reach up and slap her in the face. The man doesn't necessarily have this, but he will (maybe when he gets married) eventually regret his previous actions.
Of course it would! The person responsible for any resulting possibility should maintain a careful life in order to prevent anything such as an unwanted baby to happen. People have sex and then the girl says, "Oh, i didn't know..." or "I didn't think it would happen to me". That's just it - if the person does think and take care, then there is no problem.
"How about keeping our own population "in check"!? Do we really need anymore unwanted
children in this world to adopt?"
Ohhhh, so this is like China, eh? Aborting all children and impeding on individual rights that way. :P Abortionists claim that their rights have been infringed - I think it would work vice versa, too. Those who legitimately have children would be infringed this time.
I would suggest that those with legitimate children have priority in rights. If we were to crack down like so, would legitimate people be happy?
As I say, the moral and ethical implications are extremely large. If the lady is terminally ill or the baby is going to have a fatal disease upon birth, it might be better for the baby to end life before knowing it - miserably. The same with the woman - if she has no ability to care for it - no welcoming parents, even, that baby could well end up in the gutter. Yet, this matched with taking responsibility with previous sexual actions, or the soul and rights of the baby.... It creates a big mess in which we will never truly come to a decisive conclusion.

YOU could have been an aborted fetus- your life and what you've become would just not have come to exist.
Secondly, although the "less unwanted children" thing makes sense, it's just not right to convert the value of life into statistics. One can logically assume that if there aere less people, ther is less crime. But you also can't ignore that alot of people started their lives as unwanted children, but still did great things with it.

By three months (and often earlier) the baby has nerves (ie can feel pain), and it happens very often that an abortion takes place after the third month.
As for your argument about not having sex being wrong because it denies a baby its right to life - there's a big difference; in the one, there IS a baby there already, in the second, there's only the possibility.
I'll give you an example. There's a family; the mother has TB, she's had four kids, one is dead, one is blind, one is deaf, and the last also has TB. Then she gets pregnant. Should she abort?

The other ones do not. Belief laws are not necessary for society to exist but exist because some people want to force their beliefs on other people. An example of this is gay marriage.

Both of these tactics don't work as they give kids the wrong idea or the kids don't believe it and start having sex.
Schools and churches should not teach kids about sex only the parents. i know it can be hard but with parents their learning sex from a person who has done it and probably has a normal opinion on it. I agree with you that they shouldn't teach sex religously because its just not right.

I think life does not startuntil the sperm and the egg cell combine and form a zygote, just depends on where you believe life begins. Also god is pro-life because one of the ten commandments is thou shalt not murder their neibor. And medically a fetus is alive as it breaths eats and its heart beats.

my positives/negatives comment was misworded what i meant was is that the positives at least make life worth living and if not then a person has the right to kill themselves.
back to my original argument. we should all reflect on how lucky we all are to be alive. the right sperm cell fertilized the right egg cell and you survived all the risks of you dying as a fetus and infant and we are who we are today imean what if you or me or any of your loved ones was aborted?
Not allowing abortion teaches more responsibility to kids. education can only help so much. and scare tactics usually don't work.( for instance my school said the odds of getting an STD from any sexual intercourse is 1 in 4, which obviosly is not true), i'm not saying its not a risk but not incredibly likely. When you make a mistake like having sex at too young an age and getting pregnant you need to have a consequence that you cannot get out of it. teen pregnancy will decrease once you take the option of abortion off the table. abortion is also like assisted suicide being legal. as you can see recently abortion has started taking that path.
Legal turns into accepted
accepted turns into funded
funded turns into presssured
pressured turns into Reqired to lower the population.
anyways every wrong decision reqires a consequence that you cannot get out of. abortion is like putting someone in jail but give them the option of getting out. Of course not on that scale but in the same ballpark.

When Does Human Life Begin?
This is a note that may generate some discussion and debate. It was occasioned by a bulletin board set up by a political action group at our college. The board claimed that while philosophy and religion may have different opinions concerning when life begins, science has no such problems. Students were told that biologists were unanimous in agreeing that life starts at fertilization, and that there was no dispute in the scientific literature. Besides being a parody of science (i.e., that scientific facts are the objective truth and that all scientists agree about what these facts mean), it is wrong. I have read a wide range of scientific positions on when life begins, and these positions depend on what aspect of life one privileges in such discussions. Here is my classification scheme concerning when human life begins. You may have others.
* The metabolic view: There is no one point when life begins. The sperm cell and egg cell are as alive as any other organism.
* The genetic view: A new individual is created at fertilization. This is when the genes from the two parents combine to form an individual with unique properties.
* The embryological view: In humans, identical twinning can occur as late as day 12 pc. Such twinning produces two individuals with different lives. Even conjoined ("Siamese") twins can have different personalities. Thus, a single individuality is not fixed earlier than day 12. (In religious terms, the two individuals have different souls). Some medical texts consider the stages before this time as "pre-embryonic." This view is expressed by scientists such as Renfree (1982) and Grobstein (1988) and has been endorsed theologically by Ford (1988), Shannon and Wolter (1990), and McCormick (1991), among others. (Such a view would allow contraception, "morning-after" pills, and contragestational agents, but not abortion after two weeks.)
* The neurological view: Our society has defined death as the loss of the cerebral EEG (electroencephalogram) pattern. Conversely, some scientists have thought that the acquisition of the human EEG (at about 27 weeks) should be defined as when a human life begins. This view has been put forth most concretely by Morowitz and Trefil (1992). (This view and the ones following would allow mid-trimester abortions).
* The ecological/technological view: This view sees human life as beginning when it can exist separately from its maternal biological environment. The natural limit of viability occurs when the lungs mature, but technological advances can now enable a premature infant to survive at about 25 weeks gestation. (This is the view currently operating in many states. Once a fetus can be potentially independent, it cannot be aborted.)
* The immunological view: This view sees human life as beginning when the organism recognizes the distinction between self and non-self. In humans, this occurs around the time of birth.
* The integrated physiological view: This view sees human life as beginning when an individual has become independent of the mother and has its own functioning circulatory system, alimentary system, and respiratory system. This is the traditional birthday when the baby is born into the world and the umbilical cord is cut.

164,abortion,"I mostly ignore these abortion debates, but felt compelled to actually write a comment of substance,
As much as pro lifers would like to make choice about fetus personhood they ignore the realities of womanhood. They ignore the fact that it takes 2 to tango, but one to suffer the consequences. They belittle the consequences and say things like “give it up for adoption” without considering the realities of things like job loss and education that are not inconvenient, but ruining in the long term. One of the most important factors in women's advancement in society has been their ability to control their fertility. More than any law, the ability for a woman to chose when to become pregnant has led to higher rates of education and employment success.
Let me make this clear… when the Founding Fathers lived…. Abortion was LEGAL.
Abortion did not become illegal until 1857. Before then midwives distributed herbs and root mixtures to cause abortion, then called “quickening”. The group? The AMA! A large part of this push for criminalization was an attempt to push midwives out of the market in order to open up more patients for doctors. The bases of their argument was not moral, but instead nativist. Look up Dr. Horatio R. Storer, the leader of the criminalization movement. He was a bigot who believed whites needed to outbreed natives, and he also included midwifery with native “uncivilization”.
The AMA did not just fight for criminalization, but also abortion under special circumstances, thus, giving the male physician total control over who may have abortions, forcing midwives out of business and establishing a medical patriarchy. This continued through the 20th century with the institutionalization of health care which did nothing to stop abortion, but drove it underground.
Through the 1950s and 1960s abortions became more difficult, more dangerous, and more expensive to obtain. This led to reform legislation long before Roe v. Wade. By 1967 12 states had already passed legislation. The battle for most of US history was not a moral one, but one of womens place in society, patient rights, and civil liberties.
Some argue the cycle of child birth and rearing is a consequence for actions, personal responsibility bla bla bla, in other words I know enough to force my opinion on a decision I have not had to make, and for the guys, never will. When we say “consequences” we mean consequence, singular, for the woman, doubled in guilt through blame of questioning morality to be in the situation to begin with.
In the words of Supreme Court justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter: "At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."
This is seen as immoral in our society by some, yet Viagra commercials are acceptable.
We can debate about teaching abstinence in school, yet have no problem with erectile dysfunction drug companies handing out pens to our doctors.
The best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy is through sexual education and ready access to contraceptives, two things many pro-life people are against.
Even in a perfect society where we are educated, have ready access to contraceptives, unique and individual cases arise that must be looked at with an objective and clear eye each and every time.
One thing is for sure, criminalization kills and does not prevent abortion.
43% of the worlds abortions are done illegally.
Pro life people often demonize those who simply look at reality, the consequences from the past, and the idea that such a decision is for the individual not the state to make. They talk about baby killers, social engineering, insane conspiracy theories etc.
I think –Planned Parenthood- says it best on their website,
“If you are pregnant, you have options. If you are trying to decide if abortion is the right choice for you, you probably have many things to think about. Learning the facts about abortion may help you in making your decision. You may also want to learn more about parenting and adoption. Only you can decide what is best for you.”

So yes abortion = killing a human. Killing a human without reasonable justification = Murder. So abortion = Murder.

As to your questions, all good ones by the way: 1. The State's answer: Tell them that rape is horrible, a vicious but cowardly act, should definitely be prosecuted. Explain (at their level) that there are many couple waiting for a child, that while they are too young to bring a child up, they are old enough to provide this gift of life. Also that they still have the choice to make, and whatever they choose you will assist, uphold and defend their decision. Therapy is also expected to happen during this time. 2. The State's answer: The same as # 1 3. Kids waiting for adoption are given hope , therapy and are placed hopefully in good homes while waiting. The real challenge is to connect adopting parents with them. Most people think they must have a new born, but are willing to listen to alternatives when they realize the cost of adopting a newborn. More attention needs to be paid on adopting other aged children. Public awareness and work done by public agencies, go a long way in assisting adoption agencies in getting that message out. More funds need to be allocated towards this end. 4. That conversation is solely between the mother, her physician and if she has one her spiritual leader. Whatever, her decision it must be honored by all. 5. There is truly more than enough love out there. What there is not enough of is funds, support, therapy and people willing to be involved. Adoption is VERY expensive no matter what the age of the child and newborns being the most expensive. Also some States have really whacky laws. For instance. In the State of Florida, You can be single, married, divorced or gay and be a foster parent. However, you must be married or have REALLY good connections to adopt these same children. Single, divorced are discouraged and find it harder, and gays cannot adopt at all. However, there are many families in these categories that are already successful foster parents. As for going through abortion and changing your mind, I don't think abortion plays that big of a part. Those that have undergone the procedure seem to understand what they went through and use it as a tool to move on better equipped. Those that use abortion as a method for birth control probably need some therapy, as the abortion is not the problem, the personal attitude about pregnancy, relationships and intercourse or intimacy need to be looked at. Allowing abortion as an alternative is a legal and viable one, as long as all other aspects have been looked at and addressed. I almost neglected to say: EDUCATION, EDUCATION, EDUCATION! This is the most basic answer. Working with pre-teens and teens, male and female, will get better results than any politician, physician, scientist, or arm chair quarter back will ever produce.

930,abortion,"I believe that in almost every situation, abortion is wrong. I find it disturbing that so many people think it is completely okay to murder an unborn baby. Many say that this is not "technically" murder, but I want to know what gives you the right to say that a fetus is not a human life. In my opinion, the minute the sperm and egg meet and the fetus is created is when a human life and a soul are created in that child.
There is only one situation in which I think abortion is a necessary evil. When a woman is physically incapable of carrying the child that she conceives (as when an 8 year old is raped and cannot carry the child) this is the only situation in which abortion should be allowed.
I believe that in this life, we are meant to suffer the consequences of our actions, therefore I believe that if a teenage girl conceives a child ( through consensual sex ) she should carry that child and give birth to that child and, at that point, she may choose whether keeping the child or putting him/her up for adoption is better FOR THE CHILD.
This is my main point in all of this. What is best not for the mother, but for that innocent child, is what we should concentrate on in making all decisions during and after pregnancy and, if you choose to keep the child, throughout his/her life.
With all due respect,

3689,abortion,"To answer this question, it is best to determine whether or not the fetus is actually alive when the abortion takes place before considering further details. Let us first take a step back from such a controversial issue and define "life" in a human adult.
An adult coma patient, as an example, is regarded as "alive" if and only if he or she has a heartbeat, regardless of whether or not he or she could survive without the assistance of machinery.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the heart begins to beat at five weeks. However, the Mayo Clinic numbers the weeks according to the start of the last period so that conception is regarded as having happened in week 2; thus the heartbeat begins during the 4th week after conception. This date is clearly within the range of the first trimester, a time frame which is generally considered acceptable for an abortion to take place.
Of course, brain activity in the fetus does not begin until approximately twenty-five weeks after conception. However, if one considers brainwaves to be the defining of life in a human, then one may argue that the fetus is not alive. Before taking this defense be sure to consider coma patients with no brain activity--should they all be killed immediately even though there is evidence that they can come back and return to their lives? The two scenarios are not unrelated, and a stance in one requires a corresponding stance in the other.
Alright, so now we have discussed the conditions of life. From this point on, I will operate under the most basic assumption--that the beating of the heart signifies a life and that the levels of brain activity cannot be a decisive measure. Now let us move on to some of the arguments common from the pro-choice side.
First, that if the woman was not impregnated through a consensual act she should be permitted to abort the pregnancy and not have to carry the child of her attacker. While I pity in woman in this situation, we must be clear on the subject of to who's rights we are referring. The woman should have the right to move on from her attack yes, but this is a right based on compassion rather than morality or legality. The fetus should have the right to life--even if that life will be partially lived in foster care or with an adoptive family--which is a right based on both morality (lived and let live in its most literal sense) and legality (murder is a crime punishable by jail-time or even death).
Second, that if the parents are teenagers they cannot be expected to care for a child and should terminate the pregnancy. Again, I acknowledge that this can be an immensely trying time, but, again, the ease of one or two people's lives does not trump the continuation of another. If the child truly cannot be kept by "too young parents," there still exist care options for parent-less children.
Third, that the above is all well and good, but that child services cost taxpayers a ridiculous sum of money. In response, I can offer only the following: well then, people need to control their sex drive.
Now, back to the immediate topic at hand: should abortions be legal? By my definition of life--the start of the heartbeat--the expecting woman has a four-week window in which she can get an abortion before the fetus is alive. It takes two weeks for a pregnancy to be able to be detected, so this woman has, at most, two weeks in which she should legally be allowed to get an abortion; this is assuming that she immediately begins checking for pregnancy, so it may actually be less of a window if any at all.",3,1,"i am against abortions"

Or maybe an overabundance of "appeal to emotion ," "appeal to motive," combined only with "spotlight fallacies" rather than hard facts?

3746,abortion,"All life on Earth was created, and it is therefore morally wrong to deprive an unborn child of its God given right to live. Even though it may not be fully formed, a fetus in the second trimester is still able to feel pain. Although the baby is still in the womb, it will have its organs early on, so even when you abort it in the first trimester, you are still killing a living thing, a human. ABORTION IS MURDER! And I'll bet if you asked an unborn fetus whether he fancies the idea of being murdered, it would tell you to at least wait until it was old enough to fight back. All life on Earth was created by the almighty God, and so it follows that only the creator should take it away. As unbelievable as this may sound, your hard earned taxes go toward keeping abortion clinics running. Rape may be an excuse for an abortion, but there are other options besides abortion. Rape is horrible. But why should the child pay for the wrong doing of another? The baby is innocent of the offense and his life need not be taken because of the act of another. Just because your baby is going to be born with some special needs does not mean you can terminate him before he is born. Give him a chance. Miracles happen. Think about it.

So the question then becomes not whether it is the woman's right to do something with her body, but that given that she accepted the risk of pregnancy (except for rape) by engaging in sexual penetration, that her rights are not unlimited. They should be balanced against the interests of the unborn. We can argue the degree, but the principle stands.

4296,abortion,"I don't think many people feel abortion shouldn't be an option for rape victims. My question, though, was why we inherently value that child as lesser (not legally but colloquially). I'm going to have to take issue with a few of the statements you've made as well.
1. While no hard numbers exist, it has recently become clear that partial-birth abortions (late term) is almost never required to ensure the women's safety. I'm talking .1% of abortions performed.
2. I'd ask this question--is there any 100% effective form of birth control? The last time I checked there was not, and so any person engaging in penetrative sexual behavior takes on the responsibility for potentially conceiving a child.
3. Abortions are surprisingly unsafe. This is not a reality that has been reported by the press because its existence would detract from many of so-called benefits to abortion. http://www.slate.com/id/2285988/. The article suggests that abortion can be a relatively safe procedure, but that the kinds of professionals performing the procedure (generally the least capable physicians) creates a situation where the danger is increased dramatically.
4. The child might not have the best life, but I would still think it would prefer a life. If the mother is that incapable a parent, she should just get her tubes tied.
5. Yes, contraceptive methods need to be better taught. However, I think they should be taught from the angle that having sex is not a zero-cost activity. By engaging in the practice, you take on the responsibility for the potential outcomes. You must be responsible.

1933,abortion,"Abortion as an act is wrong you are deliberatley ending the life of an unborn baby who has a beating heart from week 5 and a nervous system from week 8 which enables them to feel pain which discredits the theory that the fetus does not feel pain or is not a human being.
Another argument is it is the womans right too choose, women may be able to validate her reasons for wanting an abortion but wheter you believe it to be right or wrong she is making a selfish choice to benefit herself and her current lifestyle with the majority of the reasons for wanting an abortion is simply that the woman is not ready to be tied down with a baby (but was ready to in have unprotected sex fully aware of the chance of pregnancy)
Once the wheels are in motion for an abortion the medical agencies involved are obviously pro abortion and there is no inbetween agency to determine whether the woman is really happy with her decision this leads to many problems as the woman is not really making an educated decison with information from both sides, firstly there may be medical problems later on in life which can result in infertility, secondly the mental problems numerous women have suffered in later life due to abortions and thirdly the culture that abortion can be used as a form of contraception as alot of younger women are not fully aware of what is really being done other than that they just want the baby to be gone so they can go back to normal.
I personally would not like to see abortion totally stopped as it would cause more problems than solving and to go back to the days when women tried to abort there own babies or did so illegally is not what anyone wants. But rules of abortion must be stricter an abortion can take place up to 6 months, which no matter what you believe is abborant and is murder.

I agree a woman should certainly have the right to choose. However, I agree with caveats:
1. There does come a time at which the woman is carrying a living human being. What about the day before having the baby? Is it not a baby because it hasn't been born yet? If the mother is in labor and changes her mind, should she still be able to choose? I know those are drastic and unrealistic examples, but the point is that scientifically we must find a point at which the woman can no longer choose because it would be clear murder at that point.
2. Okay, if the woman has the right to choose, then so does the man. I do NOT mean by this that the man should be able to tell the woman she MUST or MUST NOT have an abortion. However, abortion is often the result of a woman not yet ready to be a mother. Okay, fine, but the man should have the same choice. On this particular point, the fact that he his not the pregnant one is irrelevant. The reason for the choice is the point. If she can choose not to be a mother, then the man should have exactly the same right to choose that he is not yet ready to be a father. If she chooses to have the baby, then he can choose to "abort" his connection to it. Fair is fair.",3,1,Nay

4806,abortion,"1. An unborn baby is still a baby.
Yes. Just as a toddler is a man, or a joey a kangaroo. You say that an unborn baby is not a baby because it cannot function on its own; it relies on its mother. Does not a baby at a day old rely on its mother? You also say that biologically speaking, the unborn baby has miles to go before reaching the biological structure of a normal human being. That is true - but it is also true for babies & toddlers. A baby has approximately 300 bones, a full grown man around 270. A baby cannot say anything, nor see anything. A full grown man can. What you're saying is that a fetus is still biologically undergoing cellular reproduction & division. So is a baby!
2. Aborting the unborn child is murder.
Once again, yes. You speak of the fetus as a flea that sucks off a dog's blood to survive - is a flea not a living organism? Are not parasites living organisms? It seems to me that your definition of 'living' means being able to live off on its own, without relying on anything. We rely on many things to survive, including food, water, oxygen, sleep, and the like. So does the unborn child. Looking at it closely, they may seem separate; but from afar, they are the same pattern: grown man & unborn child - relying on external variables beyond his control to survive.",3,1,Nay
4806,abortion,"Yes, but that is the parents' consequence for having sex in the first place. We all know that contraception is not the most perfect science, and moralists around the globe are reserving sex for marriage. By marriage, we mean the union of two financially-capable & emotionally-ready adults. When these two adults are married, that is the time to have sex. But two teenagers wanting a couple of hours of pleasure? They are playing with fire. If the girl got pregnant, there are always other options. That is why there are orphanages, or social centers, or adoptive parents. But to literally rid yourself of the baby? That is like a mother telling her family, "I'm tired, I'm leaving," and dumping her family because of her personal interests. If you think the baby deserves a better fate then why the hell did you have sex in the first place?",3,1,Nay

Therefore abortion, like adoption should remain a choice.
Killing a baby is legally, and ethically wrong. Aborting a fetus (within the legal framework) is legal. As far as ethics go, the mother and the family make that decision. There is nothing wrong with abortions. Most abortion are spontaneous, done naturally by the body for various reasons.",3,1,Yes

But going back to the fact that there could be diseases that are transmitted from the the mother to the baby, does this mean that, knowing that for example, we would bring out a baby who will be sick? I really don't see how, in that situation, abortion is bad.
Other case, if the mother doesn't want the child, do you think she'll happily raise the baby? If the baby comes out and isn't love... is that better than abortion?

5147,abortion,"Let me begin by saying that I believe that both sides of this argument have perfectly valid arguments. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this. In fact, there isn't any sort of inherent moral nature with regard to the topic, but rather a personal view of the issue which we see through our own moral lens.
Personally, I am pro-choice. And I decided this because I asked myself the same question that both sides of the argument have asked themselves: what rights are to be owed to this fetus? And, more importantly, why? I believe the fetus, by virtue of its existence, represents potential and it has the right to be regarded as such. It represents the potential to be a human being, to have a place in this society, and to be a contributing element of society. As far as why, I don't think any elaboration is necessary to answer that question: we all start out as potential. What might justify an abortion is a consideration of the infants potential with regard to the circumstances that surround the woman who is giving birth to the infant. Can the woman support the infant? Will the infant have a nurturing environment to grow in? From a demographical standpoint, the woman might want to consider the population density of where she lives, and how bringing in another life to that population might affect the overall population.
I do not believe in arbitrarily aborting a child. But if, after having considered some of the things I've mentioned, the mother decides that it is best not to have the child, if only to, for example, prevent the child from going through a childhood that would be hardly conducive to a meaningful life and perhaps more so towards a miserable one, then that really is her choice. It is the responsibility of the parent figure to decide what is best for his or her child. One may argue that by choosing to abort, the parent is depriving the child of even having a chance to thrive in the world. But a just-as-valid counterargument might be posed suggesting that the such has been considered and the means to encourage and nurture that kind of life are ultimately lacking or entirely unavailable.
The issue of abortion is neither definitively a good thing or a bad thing. While from a moral standpoint, some may not believe it to be the rightful choice of the mothers, it is inevitable that it will still be the mothers (or most likely, rather) who make the decision. So if we truly believe in either pro-choice or pro-life, it is decidedly up to our own volition to promote our respective views so that those making the decisions may potentially be enlightened with our own views.",3,1,Yes
5151,abortion,"It is risk that is taken once you've accepted the operation. Any operation has its own risk. Are you going to sue a doctor for not having a successful operation? No!

5151,abortion,"First, I am going to answer to your question. Yes, a human is a living that breathes and feels. No it doesn't have to be able to hear, or talk or see. If you consider all of those senses, people who have disabilities wouldn't be considered human. But feeling is a must. Don't we always say that people who are cold and have no feeling are not humans? Well here's the same thing. The fetus isn't a human yet. Besides, according to Stats Canada, most cases of abortions are done before the first 12 weeks. You say that if the unborn baby had a voice it wouldn't want to be killed. True. I agree with that, but here's the thing it doesn't. It doesn't know what death is. They don't know what sufferance is! I repeat, it is not a human yet!
To your argument that says that you were nothing in the womb and were only something once outside, do you remember what it was like in there? Did you have any memories whatsoever that confirms that you were living before those 12 months and that you felt something? You do understand that if the fetus is removed, it doesn't even realise it, right?
To your other argument concerning their guilt, it was decision. They decided that they couldn't handle the baby. I'm gonna ask one honest question, would you rather see a woman feel guilty and depress for a long or short while or see both the child and the mother suffering because of diverse reasons?
As for the doctor situation, as you said it, they never wanted to cause any harm. We are humans, we make mistake too. People sue them. If they were to win in court wouldn't the money come back to the patient? But here's the thing : operations have risks, you accepted them. Don't go blaming the doctor who is, hopefully, trying his best to make a good operation.
And I'm gonna apologize beforehand. I never said anything about prematured babies. I'm talking about a fetus that might have, oh I don't know, HIV? handicaps? Will they have a healthy life? I doubt it. A normal, could be. But healthy, I wouldn't bet on that. Just for an exemple, per 10000 cases of HIV, 2500 of those cases are caused by childbirth.

4763,abortion,"I have said this before and I'll say this again. We can try to influence a woman's decision, to abort or not. A father has the right to INFLUENCE not DECIDE as you and I have the right to influence. He can tell the mother, "Honey, let's keep the kid," but the woman can still decide no and vice versa. In the end, it is solely the woman's choice, as it is her body. On the comment of the baby, the baby (in my opinion) is not alive yet, therefore the woman can decide, with the same decision for her as giving blood away.
Let's ignore abortion for the moment. Let's say the two of us are kids on a playground. You have a toy that I want. I ask you if you could share it with me. That's me trying to influence you. Now, do you have to follow influence? No. You can decide to keep the toy, or give it. That's your decision. This is how the decision making for abortion works. The father can influence, but he can't decide. It's up to the woman.

2812,abortion,"Well i kinda missed the heat of the argument sadly... but here's what i think.
Many people argue pro-life based on a babies potential for life (including people in this debate). This is clearly a flawed argument however. so called "potential for life" can be traced back to long before a babies conception, it could be argued that its "potential for life" is when a husband and wife meet for the first time. By this argument, birth control pills should be prohibited because we are essentially "killing unborn babies" and even more extreme: kids should be encouraged to have sex because any child who does not when they are older is "killing" all of those babies she had the potential of making.
The potential for life should not be considered in abortion decisions, only ACTUAL life should be considered.
In this debate, is see pro-lifers are arguing that babies are "alive" and "can feel pain." Yet strangely enough the vast majority of pro-life people are NOT vegetarians and are willingly inflicting pain upon hundreds if not thousands of animals throughout the course of their lifetime! The ability of something to feel pain also does not give it basic human rights at all. In fact, many would argue that although unborn babies can technically feel pain, their brains are not yet developed enough to "understand" that this pain is... well... painful! they just feel another sensation. Also, as we all know, babies do not have a developed memory. This means that although they may feel pain at one moment, the next they have forgotten about the pain and essentially it is as though the pain never even happened! Killing (as you call it) an unborn baby is in fact much BETTER than killing an animal because the animals have fully developed memory and fully developed senses, and they will realize what is happening to them.
All in all, neither an argument based on potential for life nor one based on unborn babies ACTUAL life stands up to YOUR own actions. You betray your beliefs every day, and consider what you are doing perfectly fine(because it it perfectly fine). it would be absurd to force people to constantly make babies or to be vegetarians, and for us to live our lives, others must make sacrifices.",3,1,Yes

After reading some of your previous posts in this topic I see one line of reasoning you use quite a bit to justify your stance is "the pain inflicted upon the unborn child", This would seem plausible after the first 4-to-5 weeks after conception once the cerebral cortex has begun to develop but before that stage this argument would seem to have little merit.",3,1,Yes
4763,abortion,"1.) Throughout history, people have used four words to make a point. MLK said, "I have a dream." John Lennon said, "Give peace a chance."

In theory, Kevorkian killed them, with the person's permission.
2.) About your analogy with the woman: she's not in trouble with the law because of her attempt. She's not taken into jail in a police car, given a trial and having one strike on her record. Yes, she taken to a mental facility, and yes, she gets questioned, but that's to assure that she doesn't try to kill herself again. Assurance, yes, arrest, no. And there is no "mandatory trip to the nuthouse". If you tried to kill yourself, I'm sure you would feel better once you've gotten some help.

4.) To be completely honest, I don't see a case where, "It's the woman's choice, not yours," is a false phrase. In abortion, it's completely true. A pregnant woman doesn't stand over your shoulder and tell you what to do. As I've said before, you have the right to influence, but not decide. Why should you decide for a pregnant woman?

To determine when a life has actually started, and when destroying that life would actually constitute legal murder, I think we have to establish when that life falls under certain principles. So what constitutes a human life? I'm going to have to say anything past the level of fetus, so roughly 5-6 months after conception. Anything before that, it is simply not a human life. It does not have human attributes, it merely has "potential" for human life. Yet destroying potential is not the same as actually destroying life.

Because they aren't highly intelligent beings walking around, talking and living their life out. In the end, a human is not a "Human" until they have a brain and are using it to learn about and engage the world. Do you consider an individual sperm to be a human? What about a solitary ovum? Of course not. Each is a single cell. Each is half of the final product: A solitary, fertilized egg. A lone cell, or two separate cells used to make it, are not in and of themselves a human. A cancerous growth, inside a human, is not itself human. It's just a small group of cells from that person. You have no problem killing the cancerous cells because even though they are technically part of that human, they are individual cells, and those individual cells are causing an issue for a much larger group of cells: "the human".

I can safely assume that there ARE people that can't afford that. Perhaps they are still in school, they can't work all the time to get income; some of the time, I can see it. If they can't pay for the expenses, how would you afford the child when it's born? 'You could put the child up for adoption.'

A pregnant woman is on her way to get an abortion, along the way she becomes a victim of a shooting, killing her unborn child.

Should a Judge not have a say so in the sentencing because it was " her body"The end result was the same, the removal of an unwanted baby.

394,abortion,"I would agree with you that the choice as to the morality remains largely subjective, and a variety of different opinions can be taken as valuable, however I would suggest that it is still right to legislate on the matter.
You refer to the birth mother's choice and command over her own body, and from there it follows that she be the deciding authority on what happens. This is the case, justly, in most law, however it ceases to be the case when the mother is not the only interested party. One cannot kill to save one'self if the person you kill is not the aggressor. Here we see a distinction - when our choices as to out own bodies deprive other's of their own autonomy. A baby/foetus cannot be seen as an aggressor - so they have all the moral qualities of a bystander, inadvertently effecting a mother's body.
We then have the problem of whether or not we can consider the baby as having the right not be unjustly killed. They are incapable of forming an opinion on the matter, and the birth mother has a conflict of interests. There is no one who can judge competently whether the child has the right to stay, which would curtail the mother's rights over her body.
The law is justified in preventing us from doing wrong to others, and is it not justified in curtailing one choice because it may do direct harm to others? The law cannot consider any of the relevant agents to be qualified to make the decision, so the action must be averted, due to the fallibility of the actor and the risks of her being wrong.",3,1,"Abortion should not be legal"
394,abortion,"Surley you will agree that the law cannot appoint a guardian for an almost-person? And if they could, the guardian would always have to advocate on behalf of not killing the person. A court cannot rule the end of a person's life without (in the USA and other such jurisdictions) a) proof of guilt of a capital crime, or (in cases of patients who wont wake up) b) them being essentially dead already.
In the case of abortion the child is not guilty of any action, and not only is there a chance they will `wake up`, but independent of intervention or bad luck, we fully expect them to.
So would you not agree that the law cannot justifiably permit the death of an innocent person who will wake up. And thus permitting it where there is a question of personhood, to rule the death of a party who may or may not have personhood has the same characteristics as ruling death without proof of guilt or their not waking up.",3,1,"Abortion should not be legal"

I wonder how many documented times that the Fathers opinion changed a ruling. I'm thinking ot many if any at all.
