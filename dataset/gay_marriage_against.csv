408;"gay marriage";"First, religion is a red herring. Yes, it is the motive behind a lot of the opposition, but doesn't really add anything to the analysis of the arguments. The best solution is to allow civil unions for everyone (not just gay people). Maintain marriage as the subset of civil unions which consist of a man and a woman. Then slowly export law that is relevant to both marriage specifically and civil unions in general from the body of marriage law into the body of civil union law. If marriage law is eventually completely subsumed by civil union law, fine. If some elements of marriage law survive as distinct because the state has a legitimate interest in recognizing man/woman relationships, fine. The worst thing to do is to instantly undermine the assumptions of law that has developed over hundreds of years and which has only ever contemplated man/woman relationships and their effects on society (especially with respect to child birth and its consequences).";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

The study notes that "partnered" homosexuals have "outside" lovers, and are contracting the AIDS virus at alarming rates." "Xiridou discovered that the “steady” relationships were more likely to spread AIDS than were casual relationships. Why? According to Dr. Xiridou, “… risky behavior with steady partners is much greater than that with casual partners.” She notes that 86% of new HIV infections in Amsterdam occur among “steady” homosexual partnerships." I think that is some pretty darn good evidence";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"
1019;"gay marriage";"It was hard for me to decide which column to put my view into. I don't really agree with either side. I happen to believe the government shouldn’t be in the business of sanctioning marriage at all. It’s a private religious matter between a man, a woman and God. As a Christian that’s what I believe. As a Libertarian, I say you’re free to believe differently if you want. If your god will sanction a different kind of marriage, then that’s between you and your god. If you don’t believe in a god, then you should have the option of creating a legal document that says you’re committed to one another for life. (But you can’t call it marriage, because that’s a religious term. “Separation of church and state.”) One last note: [I]s it possible for a Christian couple to avoid the state’s machinery of control and still marry before God? Yes, according to pastor Matt Trewhella. “What’s recorded in a family Bible will stand up as legal evidence in any court of law in America. Early Americans were married without a marriage license. They simply recorded their marriages in their family Bibles. So should we.”";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

1014;"gay marriage";"Forget the Bible. Forget the politicians. Let's just talk common sense. It's been asked why people should be denied the right to be married simply because they are of the same gender. If they love each other and want to make a marriage commitment to each other then why is it anyone else's business? That is a fair argument. My main objection comes not from the argument itself, but from the inevitable consequence of "redefining" marriage. Once you redefine something you change it permanently, and once you declare it "changeable" you can't stop it from being changed repeatedly. Two men want to get married... and they love each other deeply and want to make their bond a legal, committed marriage. But should we allow people to marry simply because they profess love? If that was the criteria, then who's to say a group of THREE people who profess love and commitment cannot enter into a triune marriage? Polygamists can use the EXACT same arguments that people use for gay marriage. If we cannot credibly limit marriage by gender then how could we credibly limit it by number? And I don't even want to think about the slippery slope marriage will take after polygamists can marry in groups... because the bestiality folks and the pedophile folks will want their "rights" recognized, too. The only reason we're only hearing about gay marriage is because that's where the current challenge to the definition of marriage is right now. With enough legal wrangling that definition will fail and a newer, broader definition will take its place. After that polygamists will begin their own legal battle, eventually forcing a newer, broader definition. The courts will concede people's right their own lifestyle choice, whatever that may be, and they won't be able to credibly deny marriage to those in that lifestyle. Do you remember the movie The Incredibles? A good takeaway from that movie was the danger of calling everyone "special", because saying "everyone is special" was the same as saying "nobody is special". Superheroes have super powers that make them special, hence the title "superhero". Imagine if it was decided that mediocre powers could be considered "super" powers if the bearer of those powers wanted. Imagine then if it was decided that the most mundane and ordinary abilities could now be called "super powers", and anyone at all who WANTED to be called a superhero could. At this point the idea of being a superhero is DESTROYED because the definition has become so broad that it's lost all meaning. In the same way gay marriage moves the IDEA of marriage toward destruction. Once the definition is no longer absolute then any group of people - in any numbers - in any gender combinations - must be allowed the right to be married to all of themselves. That's why I would oppose changing anything about the definition of marriage, because broadening marriage is a slippery slope that would lead toward the destruction of the idea of marriage itself. Not because the Bible says so... and not because some politician says so... but because my common sense tell me so.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

Gay is not inborn, it's a path that you choose and one that you're happy with, and everyone should respect that. Similiarly, gay couples should respect that there are certain values that should not be breach within our society. Parents have too much influence on the values of the children. And they are the future of the society. And hence the prohibition.

In the UK we have a legal framework called the Civil Partnership which accomplishes much of what most gay people want when they say they want to "get married". For the sake of polluting the name of a concept that has incredibly important meanings for the devout, I think "gay marriage" in this sense is wrong.

408;"gay marriage";"You misread my argument. My argument was not: "Law has historically excluded gay marriage, thus that exclusion must be correct." My argument was: Marriage law has developed under the assumption that marriage refers to man/woman relationships. For instance, it assumes that one of them can and, with a certain probability will, impregnate the other an average of X times in the aggregate. That assumption has huge implications, and has affected the development of marriage law in countless of direct and indirect ways.

Obviously society as a whole really doesn't benefit one way or another if marriage exists at all whether it is man/woman, man/man, woman/woman, etc. Second question, so where did marriage come from? Religion!! And based on Christianity (the originator of marriage), *** marriage is wrong. But for those who point out all the divorces, Britney's 55-hour marriage, etc, religious people do not enjoy these numbers at all which is why they strongly recommend pre-marital counseling (and offer it for free mind you), and marriage counseling for when problems occur.

You said: "...marriage laws which strengthen and support those relationships and therefore strengthen and support the stability of the child's home..."

But what about the "sterile heterosexual"? "...marriage laws which already apply to sterile people, old people, and others who cannot procreate without outside help..." What that argument assumes is that if the state is truly interested in procreation, it should engage in invasive and costly determinations about the fertility (and procreative intentions/proclivities, presumably?) of each prospective couple.

408;"gay marriage";""Fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law." does not follow from "there is no aspect of marital law that requires or inquires about fertility" One point of defining marriage as a heterosexual union is that it allows statistical inferences about procreation without inquiring about fertility. To your request: I hope the following clarifies my position. It could apply to certain tax breaks, alimony, divorce court costs, insurance programs--separately or in combination. If you want to reduce the debate to just one, I'll have to admit that our conversation wouldn't be very productive since I doubt either of us knows about the laws on such matters in detail. The state does not want to restrict how many children a family may have, because that is invasive and costly. For each child a family has, the state can save $X by affording certain rights and responsibilities to the parents as a married couple. For each marriage, the state spends $Y granting privileges and enforcing responsibilities. The state sustains a net loss for each couple to which it grants rights and enforces responsibilities where the couple bore no children. Heterosexual couples have, on average, P children per couple. Homosexual couples have, on average, Q children per couple. P Q, enough that the state has a net gain for heterosexual marriages, but a net loss for homosexual marriages. However, the state might enjoy a net gain recognizing civil unions for couples that were less costly in terms of rights and responsibilities, but with benefits more targeted to relationships less likely to procreate.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

408;"gay marriage";"ON POSITIVE STATEMENTS We each have made a positive statement. By placing an argument in the left column, you made the statement "Gay marriages are Right." By placing an argument in the right column, I made the statement "Gay marriages are Wrong." "As the one who makes the claim, it should be your responsibility to demonstrate it." In any rational discourse, each argument must end with an appeal to common sense or belief. Neither of us can formally prove our primary position, so there can't be a responsibility to demonstrate each claim. My proposition that marriage law is deeply influenced by procreation is an appeal to common sense. "Arguing generalities is easy because it doesn't require any evidence" But arguing generalities is robust against losing the forest for the trees. ON STATISTICS "What is your basis for concluding that ancient governments ... used reproduction statistics for this purpose?" If this is what you thought I meant, no wonder you demanded substantive evidence. I don't make any claim that each development in marriage law has been accompanied by a study of reproduction statistics by the law makers. My proposition is that governments have developed marriage laws in response to realities which are reflected in statistics, including and especially those of procreation. I believe that this is common sense. ON SOCIOLOGICAL FACTS "Even if I postulate that your claim is correct, you haven't addressed the sociological fact that homosexual couples are now becoming parents at faster and faster rates." I think the easy answer is "wait and see." If the implicit extrapolation you're making is correct, then the law can be adjusted accordingly. But if you want to talk it through, I'm fine with that. First, this growth might soon be inhibited by limiting factors. One example is higher costs of entry into parenthood (especially for male couples (incidentally, male/male and female/female couples should be treated differently)). ON THRESHOLDS "if across all marriages heterosexuals reproduce at rate R, do homosexuals need to match R exactly to get equal rights?" They need to cross the threshold such that the state does better than break even. "In my experience the overall rate of committed non-divorced homosexual parents is much higher than heterosexual parents ... this would appear to be to society's overall benefit." Only if your speculated stability advantage outpaces the loss on unproductive couples. "How are the interests of the *children* of a homosexual couple advanced or protected by denying their parents access to marriage laws?" They aren't. How can any child's interests be advanced by not giving him $100? This is just the same cost/benefit question. BENEFITS OTHER THAN PROCREATION "It presumes . . . that there is no benefit to society to marrying people besides procreation" Don't forget the the background principle we're operating against is civil unions, not a void of no legal relationship. OFF TOPIC: YOUR RHETORIC "Some less charitable people would call your argument an attempt to use psuedo-scientific analysis to justify a pre-existing prejudice." People less charitable than you? But by giving it voice in the debate, you seem to be one of those less charitable people. People less charitable than me would call that a cheap shot. Also, pseudo-science is one thing I have steered clear from, for which you have complained. I have taken answers to empirical questions as common sense priors rather than filling them with pseudo-scientific constructs. On the other hand, your statements about stability of homosexual relationships and your implicit assumptions about the continued rate of growth of homosexual parenthood are closer to pseudo-science (being anecdotal and unjustifiable, respectively). "Is this a one-off attempt to exclude gays from marrying (like it sounds)" I think the attitude you adopt here is largely behind support of gay marriage. Since it has been framed as an issue of prejudice, and since progressive ideals against prejudice are among the most universally appealing, people are more likely to accept the position for gay marriage without questioning it as much. That's the reason I picked up on this debate in the first place. I'm tired of hearing the worst arguments for gay marriage given prominence (and the best buried), while the best arguments against it are ignored (while the worst are paraded about).";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

408;"gay marriage";""Facts are the cure for and the antithesis of common sense..." What is your factual basis for that assertion? Because I disagree. Facts are not the antithesis of common sense. In fact, I would say that any use of facts is ultimately couched in common sense. But if you have facts that prove otherwise, go ahead. "Despite my repeated requests you have yet to point out a single tree. We’re hardly in danger of losing sight of the forest." That's because despite the repetition of your requests, they have little to do with my argument. If I pointed a distant forest out to you, and said "I bet some of those trees are the tallest trees in the forest" would you expect me to run down there are return with detailed information about one or two of the trees? Not only would it be impractical, it wouldn't prove anything. I'm arguing about aggregate costs and benefits. Talking about them individually would get me nowhere. If you still don't understand why talking about specific aspects of marriage law is irrelevant to the illustration of my argument, fine. There's no point in discussing it further. You can hang your hat on the idea that procreation has nothing to do with marriage law, and I will hang my hat on the idea that it has something to do with it. "So I guess I was the only one of us who was trying to take your formulas seriously." A fundamental concept of modern economics is explanatory but hidden formulas. Economists take those formulas seriously even though they don't believe that people and institutions explicitly and consciously use them. ”First, this growth might soon be inhibited by limiting factors.” "Sure, and aliens might grow under mushrooms too. Let’s make sure the law accounts for that possibility too." The implicit assumption that gave your growth trend any relevance in the debate was that it was going to continue unbridled. Questioning that assumption is not the same as speculating that aliens grow under mushrooms. Such geometric and exponential growth curves (whichever you were claiming) always are eventually inhibited by some limiting factors which usually cannot be detected far in advance. "controlling two consenting adults" "...to show that straight people are fully empowered to micro-manage the affairs of homosexuals" It's not about controlling them. It's about whether the state has any interest in spending resources on their consensual activities. 'I showed you that that the State does far worse than “break even” when married people have children. What happened to your response to that fact?' It doesn't matter whether the state does far worse than break even when married people have children. It matters how the state does when people have or will have children get married. If you don't understand that distinction, this whole debate must be meaningless to you. "Nobody’s talking about giving children money." It was an analogy. A pretty direct analogy. We're talking about spending resources on their parents' relationship. What I'm saying is that it doesn't help the children as much as it costs the state the spend resources on their parents plus all the homosexual couples who will have no children. OFF TOPIC DISCUSSION "And so you participate in the same act and are guilty of the same crime." I mimicked you for illustrative purposes. Your response here is obtuse. "That’s not the reason I said it. I said it because it looks like the truth. When someone struggles so valiantly to defend the indefensible, it is only logical to search for the true reason behind their fervor." Agreed. That's why I'm searching for the true reason that you are so resistant to the idea that the fact of procreation influences marriage and thus marriage laws. Presumably because you have been indoctrinated with the idea that it is solely a civil rights issue, and thus assume any argument that could undermine what you feel you are entitled to is wrong. "...reminds me of Ptolemy's cycles and epicycles." "Procreation influences marriage laws" = epicycles? For this to be analogous to epicycles, someone would have had to show that there is something wrong about that four-word statement, requiring me to make a new, independent assertion to compensate. You have questioned whether I have a sufficient basis for the assertion, but you have never directly attacked it. But be my guest. What facts would you like to introduce to show that procreation has not influenced marriage laws? 'As far as "anti" arguments, the best bet is religion' That argument is nonsensical.

Every religion has its own wedding ritual. The government has no place offering tax benefits, dower rights, or incentives to get married. Besides the costly and despicible processes of divorce, inheritance, and community property, it also creates nonsense such as people marrying for citizenship, or for native american tribal income. Marriage in the legal sense should be abolished for ALL. There is no sanctity in a government sponsored holiday (like President's Day). There IS sanctity in a religious ceremony.

408;"gay marriage";"ON STRAW MEN chasbas Feb 05, 2007 01:11 Fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law. chasbas Feb 08, 2007 07:59 I have never hung my hat on your straw man assertion that “procreation has nothing to do with marriage law”. ... I never said procreation had no influence on marriage laws. ... Again, I never said it. ON COMMON SENSE Note that my appeal to common sense arose from and has always been limited to the dispute on whether procreation has influenced marriage law. I thought relying on common sense rather than facts would be valuable since (1) I believed the proposition to be uncontroversial (2) researching the particularly facts properly would be prohibitively time consuming for a casual internet debate and (3) I believed that anyone who would not accept that proposition would be unlikely to accept any facts as supporting the proposition, since the interpretation of facts still requires common sense. The question of common sense is really a parasitic debate, but I'm willing to take it up. First, let me point out an amusing illustration. I demanded facts rather than common sense to back up your assertion that facts and common sense are antithetical (not different, mind you, but antithetical). You supplied no facts, but rather made an appeal to common sense: "Please tell me you understand this concept without me having to explain it more than that." I said "any use of facts is ultimately couched in common sense," but you didn't really engage that. The point is that every fact one person relates to another rests on a foundation of almost numberless assumptions about the world. If a person were required to factually support each of those assumptions, even assuming he could, he would then have a mountain of facts which each, again, would rely on almost numberless assumptions about the world. The way out of this conundrum is that parties rely on common sense, which, assuming a certain level of common experience, allows them to communicate an idea in a finite amount of time. I assumed (incorrectly) that "procreation influences marriage laws" would be a point you would accept without argument. You then launched into a lecture about how common sense is the disease and facts are the cure. ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE "My question to you is whether the State's financial losses (according to you) override those civil rights issues. If so, please give me another example of how the State can override civil rights based on a financial incentive." On the contrary. I say that whether there is a civil rights issue depends on whether the State's financial losses are significant. If they are, then the State has a rational basis for its distinction on those grounds. If they aren't, then the State doesn't have a rational basis on those grounds. If there is a rational basis, then it isn't a civil rights issue. If there isn't a rational basis, then it is. Read on for details. ON STATISTICS AND EQUAL PROTECTION "If it were true, would you advocate different marriage laws for whites and Hispanics?" Let's say that the state could do better financially by providing different marriage laws, thus raising the social good. Why wouldn't it? Sure, the total social good would increase at the expense of a group of people. But most laws promote the social good at the expense of a group (almost no laws are perfectly Pareto optimal). The answer is that equal protection would likely forbid the distinction. Equal protection applies at its highest standard to racial distinctions. To simplify, that's because it is in cases of race that we are most worried that the state will make illegitimate distinctions (which impose a cost on a group greater than the benefit it bestows on society), and because post-slavery race relations are such that it would impose an independent cost on society to allow such distinctions in the law, even where they would otherwise be socially optimal. You might suggest that sexual preference should receive the same standard of scrutiny under equal protection as race. I would respond in two ways. First, although in today's society I agree that there is a significant worry about illegitimate distinctions based on sexual preferences, it is not quite as worrisome as it is in the case of race because (a) race is generally more quickly identifiable (visually, often by the name, sometimes by speech patterns, etc.) where sexual preferences are not always quickly identifiable and (b) while homosexual people are finding more acceptance in various parts of society, I think race relations have stagnated, mostly due to the fact that some minority races are on average less educated, more destitute, imprisoned more, etc., and others use those factors as illegitimate proxies for how to treat those minority races. Second, even racial distinctions are sometimes upheld under equal protection where race has a direct bearing on the matter and not merely a correlation. Gender has a direct bearing on procreation, and so might survive even the strictest equal protection scrutiny were it applied. ON DIFFERENCES SUBTLE IN LANGUAGE, BUT LARGE IN REALITY "I ask you where the following analysis fails" I told you earlier that it doesn't matter to my argument how the state does when married people have children. It matters how the state does when people who have or will have children get married. Did you understand the distinction? Do you now?

1037;"gay marriage";"You ask some good questions: Marriage law as implemented in the U.S. was based on common law marriage, which itself is the result of thousands of years of tradition formalized into law. From there, marriage laws changed many times in the U.S. Some changes allowed different people to marry (blacks and whites, for example), while others expanded the rights of married people (like Federal tax breaks). Marriage laws have been constantly evolving ever since this country was born. The reason gay marriage matters is that legal marriage is much more than a vow of commitment. Legally, the least important part of marriage is the vow of commitment (it is not enforceable and these days it has no legal weight whatsoever). What *does* matter is the other aspects of marriage, like the tax breaks, the presumptions it permits people to make (like, a spouse has the absolute right to visit their married partner in the hospital, and in the absence of a Will will inherit their spouses property (with no taxes), etc.), and the laws which specifically require a married spouse (like health care). About your belief that homosexuality is a sin: You have every right to believe that, and act upon it. But you *don't* have the right to use your beliefs as a reason to deny civil rights to homosexuals. That kind of thinking is what kept black people as slaves in this country, and later enabled segregation and Jim Crow laws. Your beliefs should not enable you to pass or support laws which impinge upon my civil rights. As far as explaining the world to your children: Why not just explain that some people love other people who happen to be the same sex as they are? It's as simple as that. Homosexuals aren't different than you in any other way. You can tell your children that gays are and always have been present in society, and that they are as good and as bad as any other group of people. Tell them it wouldn't make sense to treat people differently because they are left-handed (a minority that differs from the majority in one significant way, but that isn't hurting anybody else with that difference), and it doesn't make sense to treat gay people differently either. Of course, you would have to be convinced of the truth of that statement first, before you try passing it along to your children.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

Genesis 1, I doubt you believe the Bible and you probably believe in evolution and therefore think that we are all the product of billions of years of evolution, but for those who don't believe that and truly do take the Bible as the written inerrant Word of God the origin of marriage begins with Adam and Eve. I have responded to others about some of these issues so I won't go into too much detail other than to say that comparing homosexuality to the civil rights movement is a slippery slope considering no definitive evidence has been shown to say that people are born that way. So far the only studies done have suggested it which can mean a multitude of things. Also, comparing the homosexual plight to Jews during the Holocaust is going a bit too far. No authority is abusing homosexuals and if it ever happens I will be one of the first denouncing them for their actions and defending homosexuals. This is a different issue and needs to be treated as such. Finally, your last statement "So, don't be the protector of what is right or wrong for me. But, be the defender of what is right or wrong for you and those that cannot defend their self." That is exactly what I am doing, I am defending marriage and what I believe is wrong. I am defending future generations who cannot defend themselves and who dont' realize what is even going on at this point. You and I will always disagree it appears but I do hope you know that I respect you and do not judge anyone based on their sexual orientation, it is a sin no more no less, and as it says in Romans 3:23 "For ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"
1037;"gay marriage";"kmc: "You have done a very good job of explaining your position and I respect you for it." Thank you very, very much for the kind words. There are too few nice things said in this forum. I too respect you and your views, and laud your ability to express them. I understand your point about nature vs. nurture with respect to homosexuality, but I submit that for civil rights purposes the distinction doesn't matter. Certainly race is natural and unchangeable, but *religion* is nurture and changeable (lots of people change their religion). Yet all our civil rights legislation specifically includes language to the effect of “regardless of race, religion, ...”. One sentence includes a biological characteristic of a human and a cultural choice of a human. Therefore, logically, it doesn't matter *which* category homosexuality falls into, civil rights inure to them no matter what the “cause” of homosexuality turns out to be scientifically. As far as that cause, I have always favored the “in utero” explanation, that sexuality is determined while the embryo is being formed inside the mother's uterus and bathed in hormones. That would explain why there are identical twins who are both gay, both straight, or one gay and one straight - it depends upon where the embryo physically was in relation to the hormone bath, how much each embryo absorbed, etc. Whether there's also a genetic component I am unsure, although there is some tantalizing evidence for it. Personally I have no doubt there there does not need to be any post-birth environmental factor, from my own experience I know that there was no homosexual influence whatsoever in my life, and yet I am gay. No matter, there is no precedent for denying civil rights to someone because you don't like what they're doing. If they're not breaking any laws, not hurting anyone else, not causing society to crumble, etc., then they are fully deserving of all civil rights. In fact, there are plenty of straight people who fall into all of those categories (they break laws, they hurt others, and they cause society to crumble) who *always* get their civil rights and whom no one would *dream* of trying to take civil rights away from. Take the crack addicts of the 80's. They were destructive (both to themselves and to others, including their own children who were often born severely disabled). Crack addition is clearly not a genetic affliction. Yet not a single credible person advocates sterilizing crack addicts, taking away their right to marry, or removing a single solitary civil right from them. If there had been such a movement the whole country would have (rightly) revolted against it. But if we switch the issue from crack addiction to homosexuality, many people have no problem denying and removing civil rights. That's why this all seem so unfair and absurd to me. Are you a crack addict, having children while using drugs, prostituting yourself, marrying for money? Nobody seems to mind. Are you an adult in a loving relationship with another adult and wish to legally commit to one another for the rest of your lives without hurting a soul? The country is up in arms about it. Go figure. Re Anne Heche: There is no doubt that many people are capable of having sex with either sex. Especially for women (for obvious reasons) but also for men, it is the simplest thing in the world to have sex with someone else, no matter what sex that other person is. For examples look at prisons, where the opposite sex is not available, heterosexuals, out of pure biological necessity, turn to their own sex for sexual release. They do not then consider themselves homosexual, or even bi-sexual. They are just straight people forced into a situation where they have no alternative than to “get off” with someone of the same sex. It's no big deal - they're "gay for the stay." “Are we now going to have laws in place that force homosexuals into the workforce? Will the NBA now have to have X number of homosexual coaches each year?” Not necessary. Homosexuals are already fulled integrated into every place in society, including the military (despite their repeated attempts to “cleanse” themselves) and sports. “Comparing the homosexual issue with civil rights starts down a very slippery slope and anyone who decides to take that path should be careful before doing so. “ It *is* a civil rights issue. The converse of your statement is the truth: Anyone who decides *not* to take that path, and decides to *deny* civil rights to homosexuals, should be careful before doing so. “Regarding how I will talk to my children about homosexuality. Inevitably, I will have to tell them the truth of the matter and based on the Bible it is a sin and that the government which was founded on many Christian values chose to ignore this one if homosexual's are allowed to marry one day.” Of course you can tell your children anything you want. But remember that someday they will see the world for themselves, and they will judge whether you told them the truth or not. Are you sure you want to pass on false information? This country was not “founded on Christian values” - that is a lie promulgated by the Christian Right that currently runs this country. Civil rights for homosexuals is nothing but a natural extension of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that are the *actual* foundation of this country. *That* is what my children will learn from me, and the world will back me up on it too.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

Just call it something else and it won't stir up so much controversy. It's impossible to use the word marriage anyway. Women please don't take this the wrong way.

Why can't I marry a pig? See, the sacred institution of marriage will soon mean nothing more than "temporary lover" because of the issue of divorce and homosexuality in this country. The moral fiber in the country will crumble with the loss of the family. Homosexual couples will want to raise children. Children should have a father and a mother. It's unnatural and psychologically scaring when you are raised without the natural father and mother roles. Do you know of any gay couple that has spent 60 years together? of course not. a lot (not all) homosexual relationships are based on unnatural lusts, not love anyway. they are a far more promiscuous group of people (on average) than heterosexuals because their whole life is based around it. they are extremely aggressive and will fight not only to have the same rights (which they already have) but special priveledges. oh, and why has no one ever challenged the old crap science that they are "born" gay? it's the stupidest piece of hogwash that ever brainwashed this society. If people were born gay then gays would of died out long ago because they cannot REPOPULATE!!!!! these studies and more are often biased because the people who wished for the studies are homosexuals. how come if you want to have sex with a man (which is impossible anyway) it's ok but if you want to have sex with an animal or a little child your weird? Homosexual has contributed absolutely nothing to our society except STDS. THANKS ALOT! I do realize i sound harsh but it ticks me off when people dont take responsibility and instead say "i was born like this". I realize that homosexuality is a real temptation for alot of people but everyone has their own temptations. they just learn to handle it. Someone could have a real impulse to kill people alot but does that mean it's ok? of coarse not!";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

I have no problem with people being gay, it's their choice, but however I would not call a union between two people of the same sex 'marriage' I'm not being discriminatory but a marriage has always been defined as a relationship between a man and woman. Because it is not between a man and woman, it is not right to call this a 'marriage', in saying this, I am no way demeaning the relationship two people of the same gender can have, I am merely pointing out, that there should be different words for different relationships and two males can be 'married' in a sense, it is called a civil union.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

946;"gay marriage";"The Bible says that gay marriage is wrong. So, therefore, let's prove the Bible in twelve points: 1. TRUTH ABOUT REALITY IS KNOWABLE - I didn't want to type in all-caps, but since I can't go bold I decided to use that as heading emphasis. So, here is my point. There is absolute truth. You may deny in your head, but do you live that belief? Do you walk towards a tree and say, "I can't know that tree is there, so I may as well attempt to walk through it?" Of course not. Although that example can be considered a flawed in scale or context, it was the first one that came to mind. Anyway, truth is basically anything that declares what is and denies what is not. If you cannot agree to that, then you are too deceived to continue. So, if truth declares what is and denies what is not, that implies that some things are and some things are not. This is the concept of reality. Some things are and some things aren't. In our daily life, we see that, and no contradiction has ever been found. Thus, truth about reality is knowable. 2. THE OPPOSITE OF TRUE IS FALSE - For literally anything you know, you can break down the information further and further until you reach a limit. This limit is based upon some fundamental ideas called the Foundations of Knowledge. One of these happens to be called the Law of Non-contradictions. This law states that (quoting from http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/phenom/old/lawnon.html), "it is not possible that something be both true and not true at the same time and in the same context." Thus, something cannot be simultaneously real and unreal. A block cannot be somewhere and not be in that same place. I cannot be a man and not a man (Aristotle used that example). Thus, if truth is reality, and reality cannot contradict itself, then false is not reality. Therefore, the opposite of true is false. 3. IT IS TRUE THAT THE THEISTIC GOD EXISTS - Ah, the big point. Wait, I thought I had twelve, but this is only the third point. Well, once you see the rest, this point will be further reinforced. Okay, so, since the opposite of true is false, then the existence of God is either true or false. He is either real of fake. Here are some basic arguments: *Cosmological Argument - If something is, rather than is not, then it must have a cause. See, nothing can be without a cause. This is a basic law of causality. Thus, everything has a cause. However, since the cause was, rather than was not, it must have had a cause as well. Every cause must therefore have a preceding cause, going back into eternity. However, the second law of thermodynamics prevents an eternal past. Thus, time must have a beginning. Since the laws of nature (physics, biology, chemistry, etc) all MUST occur within time, they cannot have caused time. If they could not have caused time, then they cannot have created the universe. Therefore, the universe itself must have a cause. This cause, because of the lack of time, would have to be outside of time and itself causeless. The only possible candidate for such a being is God. *Argument of Design - Evolutionists love to say that everything is random, and that design is an illusion. However, as we learn by the time we are five years old, "if it looks like a chicken, walks like a chicken, and clucks like a chicken, it's sure as heck a chicken." The same applies to design. Einstein based General Relativity on the idea that is acceleration and gravity manifest themselves the same, they are the same. If the world appears designed, then it is designed. If you'd rather have some harder evidence than logic, I would have to explain to you that the formation of a simple cell by randomness is no more likely than the formation of a working HDTV by randomness. Just research it on a Creationist site. The fact is that evolution is impossible according to biology, probability, chemistry, and all other "stry"s and "ology"s. *Ontological Argument - By definition, the greatest thing one can imagine is God. However, also by definition, the greatest thing you can imagine must be real, or else you could imagine something greater that is real, and thus it wouldn't be the greatest. But what is real is always greater than what you imagine. Thus, God must be real and must be greater than we can imagine. *Moral Argument - No matter what you believe about God, you must agree on one thing. Everyone (excluding some psychopaths) begins to feel a tug of right and wrong when they are very young. There are two possible ideas that most people accept: 1) Evolution View: Evolution programmed basic morals by natural selection. This is absurd. For evolution to produce a human is impossible enough, but for it to eventually dish out all the morals necessary for society to function would be insane. As well, some morals seem to contradict self-preservation, which is an evolutionary priority. 2) Creation View: Since the evolution view is false, that means this view must be true. God, who created us all, made us with a conscience. Most of the laws of morality are universally agreed upon. Those which are disputed are usually affected by culture and choices. 4. IF GOD EXISTS THEN MIRACLES ARE POSSIBLE. A miracle is an unexpected event attributed to divine intervention. If God exists, then He can obviously perform miracles. Why? Here are two simple reasons: *If God exists, He is omnipotent, and thus capable of overriding the natural order ot things which He created. After all, the Creator is greater than the Creation. *Ever heard of quantum tunneling? It is a phenomenon based on the fact that subatomic particles can spontaneous change positions because of probability. A proton might be one place in one moment, but light-years away the next, even if it wasn't moving. Because God is the Creator, He can control the random outcomes of probability. Thus, by causing significantly improbable quantum tunneling, He could manipulate literally anything without violating His own laws of nature. 5. MIRACLES CAN BE USED TO CONFIRM A MESSAGE FROM GOD. If miracles are possible, then we must next see if accounts of miracles are actually true. So, let's examine contradictions to miraculous account. *Some say that the witnesses are incredible. They say the people are ignorant, confused, or don't understand science. True, some witnesses may be ignorant, but how often do ignorant people, such as they claim the twelve disciples were, radically change the world? Maybe they were just so "ignorant" that they weren't closed off to the possibility of miracles. *Others say that miracles are just a basic part of human imagination, pointing to the similarity in miraculous account in all cultures and peoples. However, this could equally indicate that all miracles come from the same source, namely, God. *Finally, in the New Testament (which will soon be proved true), each miracle had a specific message and purpose, either fixing the broken or otherwise glorifying God, often defeating . 6. THE NEW TESTAMENT IS HISTORICALLY RELIABLE. There are various evidences for the New Testament as an accurate historical record. For one, there is much manuscript evidence. Some claim that the NT has changed much from the original texts. However, there are hundreds of texts from the same time period that agree on the content of the NT. As well, when looking at the original manuscripts, there is a difference of less than 2% in modern copies. The estimated accuracy of the common translations today is over 95%, and the remaining 5% consists of insignificant phrases and typos. Still others argue that the New Testament accounts were mythologized between their occurance and writing. However, a look in history shows that myths generally took at least a century or many more to develop. The New Testament was completely finished within the closing of the first century A.D., leaving no time for mythological development. In addition to that, the Gospels and Acts show characteristics very different from mythology of that time, such as highly specific names, times, places, numbers, and other information, random tidbits of seemingly insignificant events, important roles for several women, and references that ask one to check with the persons mentioned to validate their stories. Finally, several secular historians from that period either allude to or directly recall events in accordance with the New Testament. 7. THE NEW TESTAMENT SAYS THAT JESUS CLAIMED TO BE GOD. Some people deny this, but if you read the NT, you will find it true. For example: *John 8:58 - "Jesus said unto them, 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I AM.'" I AM was the name God gave Moses in the encounter at the burning bush. This is a reference with which His entire crowd, since Jews were required to study the Torah, would have been very familiar with. By saying what He said, Jesus was asserting Himself as God. *Mark 2:5 - "When Jesus say their faith, He said unto the sick of palsy, 'Your sins are forgiven.'" It was common knowledge to the Jews that only God could forgive sins. It was, in fact, a very fundamental teaching. Anyone listening would have immediatly recognized that Jesus was claiming God's authority (in one instance, the Pharisees blasted Him for claiming He was God over this very type of situation). *John 10:11 - "I am the Good Shepherd: the Good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep." The book of Psalms was well-known in the Jewish community. Psalms contained many references to God as a good sheperd. *John 9:35-38 "35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when He had found him, He said unto him, 'Dost thou believe on the Son of God?' 36 He answered and said, 'Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?' 37 And Jesus said unto him, 'Thou hast both seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee.' 38 And he said, 'Lord, I believe.' And he worshipped Him." Every Jew knew that the Messiah, the Son of God, would be equal with God, and would be God. They believe in the union of the Father and Son. Thus, in this passage, Jesus very blatantly stated His deity. He also accepted worship, and every Jew was familiar with the commandment, "Thou shalt have no other gods before Me." From this, then, it is obvious that Jesus claimed to be God. 8. JESUS'S CLAIM TO BE GOD WAS MIRACULOUSLY CONFIRMED. If the New Testament is historically reliable, and if miracles are possible, then it stands to reason that the miracles in the New Testament happened. So, then, what were these miracles and what did they mean? *Fulfillment of prophecy: Jesus' life was unique in that He perfectly fulfilled every prophecy about the Messiah in the Old Testament. This is truly a miracle. Here are some examples: *Micah 5:2 - "But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting." This verse says that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, where Jesus was born over hundreds of years later. *Isaiah 11:1 - "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots." According to Isaiah, the Messiah is to be of the line of Jesse, father of David. According to Matthew 1:1, that was indeed the case. *Hosae 11:1 - "When Israel was a child, then I loved Him, and called My Son out of Egypt." This verse prophecies the events after Jesus' birth. Herod seeked to kill Jesus, but an angel warned Joseph to flee to Egypt with Mary and Jesus. Afterwards, Joseph brought them back from Egypt (Matthew 2:15). *Psalms 78:2 - "I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old." In Matthew and Luke, you can see Jesus speaking in many parables (Matthew 13:35). *Zechariah 13:7 - "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones." After Jesus' arrest, the disciples scattered (Matthew 26:25). *Most of Jesus' miracles were miracles of healing. He made the blind to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, and the leper clean. and disease fled His presence, nobody was ever while Jesus was near. Lazarus was risen to life by Jesus' simple word. He restored life and health. He fixed what was broken. He forgave sins. These are all signs with a message. The message is one of life and peace. Jesus came to save the world. *The greatest miracle of Jesus' ministry was His ressurection. Interestingly enough, there is more evidence for it than any of the other miracles He was said to have done. Besides being documented in the Gospels, it was mentioned in various secular records, and the Gospels actually spoke of over five hundred witnesses, simply so that if people of the day didn't buy the written account, they could go ask those people. It was prophecied in the Old Testament along with the other prophecies Jesus fulfilled, Jesus Himself prophecied it, and the disciples testified to it. Many accuse the disciples of making up their story, but nobody ever allows themselves to die cruel and horrible s for a prank. Yet all of the disciples except John are historically recorded as being executed in some inhumane way. The early Christians suffered the worst persecution the world has ever known. Had the ressurection been fake, they would have given up. 9. THEREFORE JESUS WAS GOD. This part is simple. If Jesus claimed to be God, and He performed many miracles to confirm His claim, fulfilling tons of prophecies, then He must be God. 10. IF JESUS IS GOD, THEN WHATEVER HE SAYS MUST BE TRUE. Why is this? A few reasons. *It is against the character of God to lie. If God is holy and perfect, then He cannot speak anything false. If He is not holy and perfect, then He is not God. Thus, if Jesus was God, He was holy and perfect, and thus could not lie. *As well, because God is omnipotent, sovereign, and ruler over all, He could not tell a lie even if His character allowed, because reality would change to His word. The universe was formed by His word, and thus any subsequent words would alter reality to make them true. 11. JESUS TAUGHT THAT THE BIBLE WAS THE WORD OF GOD. Jesus taught many things about the Bible. He taught that it was divinely authoritated (Matthew 4:4, 7, 10, 5:17), imperishable (Matthew 5:18), inerrant (John 17:17), historically reliable (Matthew 12:40-41, 19:4-12), and ultimately supreme (Matthew 15:1-6). 12. THEREFORE, THE BIBLE IS THE WORD OF GOD, AND ANYTHING THAT OPPOSES IT IS FALSE. If Jesus is God, and God can't lie, but only speaks the truth, and Jesus said that the Bible is the Word of God, and God can't err (being perfect), then that obviously and logically means that the Bible is the Word of God and it is completely true and inerrant. Since the opposite of true is false, and the Bible is true, then anything that opposes the Bible must be completely false.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

988;"gay marriage";"While the Bible does address homosexuality, it does not explicitly mention gay marriage/same-sex marriage. It is clear, however, that the Bible condemns homosexuality as an immoral and unnatural sin. Leviticus 18:22 identifies homosexual sex as an abomination, a detestable sin. Romans 1:26-27 declares homosexual desires and actions to be shameful, unnatural, lustful, and indecent. First Corinthians 6:9 states that homosexuals are unrighteous and will not inherit the kingdom of God. Since both homosexual desires and actions are condemned in the Bible, it is clear that homosexuals “marrying” is not God’s will, and would be, in fact, sinful. Whenever the Bible mentions marriage, it is between a male and a female. The first mention of marriage, Genesis 2:24, describes it as a man leaving his parents and being united to his wife. In passages that contain instructions regarding marriage, such as 1 Corinthians 7:2-16 and Ephesians 5:23-33, the Bible clearly identifies marriage as being between a man and a woman. Biblically speaking, marriage is the lifetime union of a man and a woman, primarily for the purpose of building a family and providing a stable environment for that family. The Bible alone, however, does not have to be used to demonstrate this understanding of marriage. The biblical viewpoint of marriage has been the universal understanding of marriage in every human civilization in world history. History argues against gay marriage. Modern secular psychology recognizes that men and women are psychologically and emotionally designed to complement one another. In regard to the family, psychologists contend that a union between a man and woman in which both spouses serve as good gender role models is the best environment in which to raise well-adjusted children. Psychology argues against gay marriage. In nature/physicality, clearly, men and women were designed to “fit” together sexually. With the “natural” purpose of sexual intercourse being procreation, clearly only a sexual relationship between a man and a woman can fulfill this purpose. Nature argues against gay marriage. So, if the Bible, history, psychology, and nature all argue for marriage being between a man and a woman—why is there such a controversy today? Why are those who are opposed to gay marriage/same-sex marriage labeled as hateful, intolerant bigots, no matter how respectfully the opposition is presented? Why is the gay rights movement so aggressively pushing for gay marriage/same-sex marriage when most people, religious and non-religious, are supportive of—or at least far less opposed to—gay couples having all the same legal rights as married couples with some form of civil union? The answer, according to the Bible, is that everyone inherently knows that homosexuality is immoral and unnatural, and the only way to suppress this inherent knowledge is by normalizing homosexuality and attacking any and all opposition to it. The best way to normalize homosexuality is by placing gay marriage/same-sex marriage on an equal plane with traditional opposite-gender marriage. Romans 1:18-32 illustrates this. The truth is known because God has made it plain. The truth is rejected and replaced with a lie. The lie is then promoted and the truth suppressed and attacked. The vehemence and anger expressed by many in the gay rights movement to any who oppose them is, in fact, an indication that they know their position is indefensible. Trying to overcome a weak position by raising your voice is the oldest trick in the debating book. There is perhaps no more accurate description of the modern gay rights agenda than Romans 1:31, “they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.” To give sanction to gay marriage/same-sex marriage would be to give approval to the homosexual lifestyle, which the Bible clearly and consistently condemns as sinful. Christians should stand firmly against the idea of gay marriage/same-sex marriage. Further, there are strong and logical arguments against gay marriage/same-sex marriage from contexts completely separated from the Bible. One does not have to be an evangelical Christian to recognize that marriage is between a man and a woman. According to the Bible, marriage is ordained by God to be between a man and a woman (Genesis 2:21-24, Matthew 19:4-6). Gay marriage/same-sex marriage is a perversion of the institution of marriage and an offense to the God who created marriage. As Christians, we are not to condone or ignore sin. Rather, we are to share the love of God and the forgiveness of sins that is available to all, including homosexuals, through Jesus Christ. We are to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) and contend for truth with “gentleness and respect” (1 Peter 3:15). As Christians, when we make a stand for truth and the result is personal attacks, insults, and persecution, we should remember the words of Jesus: “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you” (John 15:18-19).";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

Constantine converted for political, rather than spiritual reasons, and so did his country men. Your date of 476 AD is a paper tiger, as the Western Empire had been falling since 285 AD, when the Empire had to be split in two because the problems facing it were too numerous for one man. Christianity became the state religion in 391 AD (Your date of 342 is wrong, as it falls during the rule of Julian the Apostate, a pagan who hated and persecuted Christians), and by this point there where hordes of barbarians roaming the country side. I stand by my original declaration. Your Ad Hominen attack against me, "you ignorant fool", was unnecessary, and falls outside of a civilized debate. Plus, if you must resort to name calling, it is most often the case that you have the weaker argument. To answer your point, while it is true that many genes can skip generations, it is still impossible for a "homosexual gene" to progress this way. The second that a homosexual gives in to this "gene", he removes himself from the so-called "gene pool". Therefore, such an argument still doesn't hold water in the face of SEXUAL reproduction. The genes MUST re-enter the HETEROSEXUAL gene pool in order to be passed along. Even if your example were the case, homosexuality as a gene would have died out very early in the cycle of human existence, since homosexuals can't reproduce.

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.” Also in Jude vs. 7 it talks about Sodom and Gomorah being punished and burning in the eternal fire was for there sexual sins.";8;1;3;"Allowing gay marriage is Wrong"

There are many people out there who have recognized the fact that they experience a sexual attraction to the same sex but make the CHOICE to deny those feelings, acknowledging that it goes against the natural order of things. The only reason this is a topic of debate is because there are those who would wish to not have to be held accountable for their actions. Furthermore, there are studies that reveal that living a homosexual lifestyle leads to an increased risk for many diseases, homosexuals experience increased numbers in numerous cancers. Sexual intercourse is intended to procreate continue the species, it just so happens that for us mammals it is quite pleasurable simultaneously We are one of few species that practice recreational sex. One can observe the natural world around them and see that male to male and female to female doesn't further the species and therefore it is unnatural.

The Bible says that people want to follow their own desires not God's (i.e. do what makes them happy, not what makes God happy), and this is a wrong attitude on the part of people. Their goal should be to please God (again, according to Scripture, see 1 Thessalonians 4:1). (3) You believe God should judge gay marriage right. I wasn't sure exactly how to categorize this, but I'm going to call it a theological error. It doesn't matter in the slightest how you think God should judge. Likewise it doesn't matter how the church thinks God should judge. Biblically speaking, God is His own Person, and He will judge according to His own will. Not the church's, not mine, not yours. (4) God judges us based on faith, not sins. Actually, the Bible is replete with judgments on sin. In fact, all of God's judgment of humankind is based on sin.

No. The Bible never talks about, but that's because it never considers gay marriage because the very issue of homosexuality is sin so gay marriage doesn't even need to be considered.

In Jude 7, homosexuality is labeled sexual immorality (and therefore a sin) In 1 Timothy 1:10, homosexuality is among a list of acts that are contrary to sound or good teaching (in other words, it's a sin). By listing these, I'm not trying to say that gay marriage is right or wrong, I'm just pointing out that when Christians say that gay marriage is wrong it is because they are being consistent with the tenets of their faith. It shouldn't really surprise anyone. Whether or not you think gay marriage is wrong comes down to your presuppositions. If you don't have a problem with homosexuality, it probably isn't wrong.

There are many things taken into consideration in regards to the rights and wrongs of homosexuality. Moral Aspect: Its not proven, but i doubt that homosexuality is something people choose. I cant imagine someone choosing a life of hardship and hatred to go along with the already difficult lives most people have. The only way i could see it being a choice is if a young child exhibits homosexual behaviors and they are not handled early on by the parents in the right way. That would lead to a further progression of the homosexuality and the further instillment of the belief that said child was "born gay". Immoral Aspect: Homosexuality is not something natural. This may seem contradictory but many animals show homosexual tendencies in the wild, type in "gay animals" on youtube and check it out yourself. That being said, homosexuality offers no propulsion of the species except for the very very basic aspect of population control. For most people there is this mentality instilled in us that Boys Like Girls, not Boys like Boys or Girls like Girls. It just goes agaisnt our instincts to accept anything otherwise. I'm hoping i'm not offending anyone here, please understand i'm using this as a soundboard to see what you all think.

Marriage is for people who love and want to spend life with each other. And as for gays, I especially think its wrong for many reasons. First off, gays get AIDS much faster and easier than straight people. Secondly, I just hate a guy that literally acts like a girl. Man up. I don't hate gay guys, I just don't like them. I've actually had gay friends. But they were normal at least, and they didn't tell the world and embarrass me by carrying their nasty boy friends around.

In fact, what I'm saying is that the vast majority would be vehemently opposed to incestuous relationships, and that by codifying the requirement for marriage as only requiring legal consent between individuals, we open the door for other behaviors. I agree with the various pro-gay marriage arguments you've made, but I think we need to do a better job figuring out why gay marriage is okay but incestuous marriage is not (incest could also be between siblings). Mostly, I favor gay marriage because I just don't care very much about it. Other people care, I don't, so I'm inclined to let them have their way. But I am wary of how this legalization could establish a pattern for future movements or even fundamentally alter gender roles.";8;1;3;No

They had just started, there was no pregnancy. They were just a consenting couple. So yes, I am seriously asking that. Tell me how an adult, consenting, incestuous couple differs from gay relationships. Tell me how a consenting polyamorous couple differs from gay relationships. I understand your obvious hesitation to make the logical linking. It would be damaging to the quest for gay marriage. Just as you say, if you marry heterosexually, how is your marriage negatively effected by a voluntary incestuous marriage? We aren't talking about procreation, just the marriage component.People have made the argument that children raised by gay couples often don't have normal development, that they lack the influence of the opposite gender. I think the first step is to analyze just the marriage and then expand to the fallout from the marriage. That is, children are beyond the scope.";8;1;3;No

I've actually read some articles discussing a higher incidence of depression and other psychological disorders for children raised by homosexual couples. Certainly, this could be because of stigma unfairly levied against them, but its also likely influenced by their gender role confusion. Your understanding of consent seems bizarre. It seems to rule out any form of persuasion. Yes, a parent would have more leverage, but that doesn't change the fact that the child legally consented. We might say a 25 year old wielded unfair leverage on a 16 year old in a state where 16 is the age of consent, we might look down on this 25 year old, but this doesn't make the consent illegal. But I think some of your own arguments have veered towards accepting that consent alone is not sufficient.";8;1;3;No
4296;"gay marriage";"I think the biggest strongest argument is the incest one, so that's the one I'm going to respond to. I think we could both agree that the benefits/costs of children being raised by homosexual couples is extremely political, not conclusive, affected by the status quo, and not terribly relevant to what we're talking about. On incest, I'm actually surprised to see your argument, that "incest is not acceptable because one is not considered of sound mental or emotional health when one sexually desire one's close relative." It's interesting, because this is exactly what people used to say about homosexuality. I think the more accurate statement would be that incest is an extreme taboo, at least in America, and only in parts of America. Many other countries in the world, see the above, condone, tolerate, and protect incest. So to be clear, I am not talking about incest where it is more appropriately labeled molestation. I am talking about incest between two individuals above the age of consent. The incest would not have to be between parent and child. It could also be between siblings. Again, the child issue isn't relevant to the relationship--they are separate issues. So long as no undo influence is levied and that each party was allowed to develop appropriately before initiating the relationship, again, I ask, given their complete and legitimate consent, how does condoning this incestuous relationship differ from the argument used to justify homosexuality? You used the argument yourself--that homosexual relationships don't hurt other people, involve two parties giving consent and showing love, etc. These same characteristics could describe many incestuous relationships. So I'm asking you to find a clear point of differentiation.

The point I was making is that the same justification used in the debate for legalizing gay marriage can be used for incestuous marriage. Cultural taboo isn't a justification. Homosexual behavior used to have a cultural taboo associated with it, making it non-unique. This is what I said in an earlier posting, "I am wary of how this legalization could establish a pattern for future movements". I'm making a slippery slope argument. I support gay marriage, but my doing so could open the door for more behaviors down the road. Right now, I think the plurality of the US opposes incest, etc. I am aware of the gay gene, although I understand it to explain only male homosexuality and female bisexuality (this is beyond the scope, but the gene is for extreme attraction to males--men having the gene would be gay, women not having the gene would be bisexual, etc.) As in any debate, I think you lost the ability to persuade anyone the second you labeled those who oppose gay marriage as "bigots".

You aren't going to change someone's opinion about gay marriage if you initiate the conversation by drawing that line in the sand. I think this is a principle which can be applied to many different disagreements--demonizing the opposition loses the debate every time. I think until the debate shifts, we shouldn't use language like that--for example, we now have equal rights for blacks, the vast majority supports this, therefore it's reasonable to label the opposition bigots for that scenario. With gay marriage, its much more contentious, so we shouldn't destroy the debate before it happens. As a separate issue, I'm curious how you view legalizing gay civil unions?

5574;"gay marriage";"a few weeks ago i also agreed with the proponents of Gay marriage .. but listening to an intelligence squared debate changed my view.. following are the reasons why i oppose gay marriage : 1. if we legalize gay marriage there will be hue and cry for legalization of other types of marriages like -group marriages- the arguments are almost same for both. and such weird types will keep emerging if we agree with marriage .. would we agree with them all as we agreed with gay marriages ? 2. i oppose any gay lovers who wants to adopt a child. i firmly believe a child need both a father and mother for proper mental development .. 3. allowing gay marriages will hurt religious minded people .. although i am an atheist i believe religion is needed for those who are uneducated .. it is only religion that keeps the average person from stealing even in great distress. religion keeps the masses of people in check .. anything to weaken their believe will not end well i have not made a single argument against gay marriage form a religious point of view.. i firmly believe church and the state should be separate we should remember that not things religion says are bad";8;1;3;No
5469;"gay marriage";"Why do people always quote separation of church and state. That is taken out of context. The original idea of separation of church and state that the founding fathers laid down was to stop the government from telling your where you could practice your religion. It wasn't intended to keep prayer out of government or school. That has been twisted by aethiests to suit their own agendas. The original law was put in place so if you felt like praying in school or government buildings or anywhere in the U.S. you could do so freely without interference from the government. Now its been twisted to do exactly what it was meant to stop, government telling you where you can and can't pray.";8;1;3;No

560;"gay marriage";"ill Probably be the first person to admit on this website that im a devout Christian (my religion is Southern Baptist if anybody is wondering) Gay Marriage is Immoral for a few reasons. 1: God says Marriage is between one man and one woman plane and simple. 2: God made Adam and Eve Not adam and steve. if god wanted us to be gay then he wouldent have put the sexual desire we have torwards the opposite sex in our bodys. 3: if he was ok with gay marriage then he would let gay couples get pregnet threw sex not by adoption. (Let me go on Record for this next statement and say this is not my Religion beliefs, this is my own personal belief) I Believe God Created AIDS and STDs as a punishment for Gays and People who have Multiple Partners. Think about it why would Thos diseases exist if God was ok with Homosexuality and having Multiple partners? Their would be no reason for them to exist. One a side note, The Great Comission in the Bible Matthew 28:19-20. "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." if anybody has any personal questions about God or developing a relationship With christ Please fill Free to message me on my Profile.

5073;"gay marriage";"There is no such thing as traditional marriage. Given the prevalence of modern and ancient examples of family arrangements based on polygamy, communal child-rearing, the use of concubines and mistresses and the commonality of prostitution, heterosexual monogamy can be considered "unnatural” in evolutionary terms.";8;0;3;"it is immoral"

5694;"gay marriage";"Personally, I am not a very religious person, but I do go by my God, and what he says. I don't have anything against Gay/Lesbian people, but I do dislike the idea, not because their "weird" or whatever some people might call them, but with the idea of following your religion. In almost all religions Homosexuality has been tackled, and disapproved very clearly. Now, lets take Obama as an example when he stated that he agrees with Same-sex marriage should be allowed, personally I thought that politically it was a very smart move, but ethically very immoral. I know many will disagree with me, but, when a President, especially the President of the United States says that, he went against not only Christianity, but all Religions. I'm not going to discuss the complications of giving birth, and illnesses of the same-sex lovers, as it happens for both straight or otherwise. I do agree that same-sex marriage is immoral, just because of what I stated earlier.";8;0;3;"it is immoral"
5692;"gay marriage";"I am not sure of your entire point because of the spelling. But what I did read says God also said owning slaves was immoral. Well that happened a percentage a wealthy whites owned slaves. It was always my guess they weren't moral. So whats your point? Is it that morals for owning slaves was ok so gay marriage is ok? Or is your point that owning people was wrong and so is gay marriage?";8;0;3;"it is immoral"
5692;"gay marriage";"The conversation is about morals. Matthew seems to be in alot of arguments for gays and athiests. So I wasn't suprised when I saw his post in this topic. So back to the topic. Our laws all came from the nible. Adams, Jefferson,Washington, and Franklin all believed God made the law of the land and man was to enforce it. So it was immoral back when our country was moral. Now gays are just another type of people. The positive is gays are adopting the kids that the heterosexuals are leaving behind. The negative is it creates people like matthew who are angry from all the teasing.";8;0;3;"it is immoral"
