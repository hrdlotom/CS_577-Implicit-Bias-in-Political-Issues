83;"gun control";"It doesn't automatically stand to reason that countries with tight gun controls are oppressive- Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia... none of these countries are as relaxed about guns as the US is, and none of them have particularly bad problems with guns and none of them are dictatorships. A heavily armed populace gives rise to all sorts of risks. The school-shootings, whilst relatively rare, do highlight a consistent failure on the part of successive US governments to address how easy it is for anyone to get hold of a gun and also highlights a failure to instruct people on the proper care and security of their weapons. I once had a discussion with a gun-owner who said that if someone broke into his house in the dead of night, he would feel much better equipped to defend himself as he had a gun, and would quite readily put a bullet into the intruder. I then pointed out that it could be his son coming home late from a night out, perhaps drunk, making a bit of noise, and that he ran the risk of shooting his child- because after all, you have to react quickly when faced with an intruder. He didn't have a response to that. I would not necessarily argue for a complete ban on firearms in a country where firearms have been part of the culture for as long as that country has existed, but tighter controls will lead to less school-shootings and better education will lead to people being more aware of the dangerous weapon they have in their home. I think far too many gun owners grow complacent about their ability to defend themselves, simply because they have a gun in their home, when after all, in a country where ownership of a gun is easy to achieve, the criminals usually have a bigger, better gun.";9;1;2;"Citizens should not have the right to own guns"

You are a genius! What a wonderful cycle of violence you have suggested…I love it! While we are at it, let’s revert back to the Wild West and bring guns into bars and nightclubs. Over 100 people die everyday in the United States from guns. Over 20 CHILDREN die everyday from guns in the United States. One day people will understand math a little better and realize civilians owning guns does more harm than good. How many “bad guys” are shot everyday by a civilian… For every time a gun in the home is used in a self-defense homicide, a gun will be used in— 1.3 unintentional deaths 4.6 criminal homicides 37 suicides Anyone with a grade school equivalent math background can easily see that guns in civillian hands do MUCH more harm than good.";9;0;2;"Given the tragedy at VT, there should be tighter gun control laws."

1596;"gun control";"I agree with you that automobile deaths are substantial, and something should be done to lessen the amount of accidents and the severity of accidents. However, I do not think it is fair to compare doctors and automobiles with guns. Mainly because how many people benefit from visiting a doctor each day? You can’t just throw out a statistic like people dying from doctors, unless you compare it to how many people are cured/saved by doctor’s everyday. For instance, if a million people a day are helped by doctors, then the stat of 274 dying a day is worthless for your argument. 100,000 dying a year from doctors compared to the tens of millions lives saved by doctors. So obviously, the risk is worth the reward. But we don’t have that scenario with guns. By far, more “good” people are killed everyday than “bad” people with guns. Collectively as a nation, the risk is NOT worth the reward. For every “bad” person killed in self defense, a kid accidentally shoots and kills a friend or himself. And the constitution does not say that people have the right to own “guns”…It say bear arms…which could mean any weapon. The authors of the constitution could never have imagined the advances in guns/weapons/ways to kill people. If they could have seen the future, then they could have listed the types of “arms”. So, people can still have weapons (swords, bows and arrows, etc.), just not weapons of mass destruction. And the purpose of the second Amendment was to protect the people from the government, not one another.

1529;"gun control";""it is not the guns fault if a murderer decides to use a gun to kill innocent humans" Well the gun certainly helps dosen't it? The point is, if you own a gun, then you must be be of the opinion that firearms are legitimate tools or weapons for protection. So most gun owners will have thier gun(s) for a purpose. Now, if your house is broken into by an armed thief, for example, it is LESS likely they will attack you if you don't start waving a gun around (considering they are similarly armed). If you are not in a position to attack them, they will probably not risk shooting you - they have also brought the weapon for 'defence'. If, however you have a gun and are threatening the theif with it, someone is going to get shot. Since guns are owned with a purpose in mind, they are considered by the owner to be a legitimate tool. If the purpose of the tool is shooting people (even in defence) then the purpose of buying a gun (for defence) is to shoot people with it. It's all very well to say that other tools can be used to kill people - hammers, cars, knives and even fertiliser as an explosive. But the difference is that the sole purpose of a gun is to shoot and threaten people with, where as all other tools are being misused if they harm someone. Guns are made to hurt people with. So, people buy guns to use as a tool, the purpose of which is essentially to hurt people. Whether or not the buyer intends to go and hurt someone specific, or even conciously, with thier weapon, they obviously believe that shooting someone is a legitimate act, thus vindicating thier ownership of the gun. Thus, guns are only owned by people who are willing to shoot other people.";9;0;2;Against.

1529;"gun control";"Yeah, thing is that the second ammendment makes the point that guns should be allowed because a _well organised militia_ is an important tool for a nation. To quote directly: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." As far as the current situation goes in the US, security there is aplenty. A 'well organised militia' it aint. Unregistered (in many states) little restricted ('no more than one gun purchase per-month' in many states is hardly restriction) and regularly miss-used guns are certainly not what the constitution was getting at. Neither organised, nor (tecnically) a militia, since a militia implies some form of military training. A good example of what the second ammendment should really take the form of is the situation they have in Switzerland. Every male over 20 (I'm sure this could be extended to women in many places if they wished) goes on national service for full military training, and is obliged to keep thier firearm in good working order in an acessible area of thier home. Some young men then go on to a career in the standing army (many spending a lot of it guarding the Vatican) but the vast majority leave and get on with thier lives. There is no restriction on carrying rifles in Switzerland, though in most places hand guns are regulated. Incidentaly, Switzerland has a murder rate of 2.94 per 100,000 citizens, where as the US has 5.9. In addition, the US has the highest ownership of hand guns in the world (29% of households), which accounts for 5.28 murders per 100,000 citizens. Switzerland has the worlds second highest ownership in the world (14% of households), half as many as the US, and these account for only 1.42 murders per 100,000. Have a look at the table here (http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-switzerland.htm). Countries with higher hand gun ownership have a higher percentage of handgun murders.. Fact. But back to the constitution: the falier of the 'it's in the constitution' argument is that you are deliberately misquoting. There is no 'well organised militia'.

1529;"gun control";"What? My argument said that because the conditions under which the 'right' to bear arms was given in the first place (ie, the weapons in question being in the hands of a well regulated militia) then the right should be void. The fact that there is almost no regulation of any kind of weapon owners, or the guns themselves, means that the militia does not exist. This removes the premise for the 'right to bear arms' being granted in the first place. It has ceased to be a right, and become a privillage. The abuse of said privillage is so high that I believe guns are no longer beneficial to the majority of thier owners. "If I interpreted the 1st amendment the way YOU interpret the 2nd amendment, I could say it only gives freedom of press and no freedom of speech or religion." Why? In the second ammendment, the existance of a militia is the premise for the liberation of arms. Freedom of the press is an entirely seperate issue from free religion or speech (in theory anyway, but if you want to argue about supressive news reporting that's another debate). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution I quoted the whole ammendment. By leaving off half the sentance, you have removed the context in which the part you quoted was made. So you have have misquoted, not I. "And your murder rate of .0059% is not impressive." You do realise that mean 0.0059% percent of people in the US last year were murdered? Using population figures from June 2006, that equates to 17,608 murders last year.

1529;"gun control";"“The entire purpose was to give people the power, if necessary to stand against their government. That cannot happen with a government run militia!” You do raise an interesting point – the amendment calls for a regulated militia, but cannot account for the regulation. This means that either there can be no regulated militia, and the amendment is impracticable, or it supports any form of armed uprising against the government for any purpose (the militia doing the uprising being regulated by 'the people', remembering that the rebellion will consist of citizens), thus invalidating the government's authority and bringing the purpose of the constitution (restricting the actions of the government by setting the basic 'rights' of citizens) into question, since it would seem to suggest the amendment supports the right of any rebel faction to rule the country by force. I guess that's almost another debate. If you'd rather keep it as a thread in this one, by all means contradict my argument, but considering my above points, for now my statement on this issue is: The amendment is either unworkable, or supports ALL anti-governmental rebellions, thus invalidating democracy as the way of a government coming to power. “It didn't say that the right of the MILITIA to bear arms.” You're right, it didn't. However, the wording of the amendment does not make the two items, the purpose of the militia and the 'right' to bear arms, mutually exclusive. To simplify the wording, as I understand it: 'A well regulated militia is vital to the security of a free state, and therefore the citizens should have the right to bear arms.' Now, as I said before, this seems to tell us that the reason the people should have the 'right' to bear arms is that a regulated militia is important to the security of the country. However, as I have already discussed above, the constitution does not provide for regulation, or the ends to which the militia would be put. If we consider that this puts the whole purpose and strength of the amendment into question, it also makes the premise for the 'right' to bear arms as illegitimate as the regulation of the militia. “I cannot go out and buy handgrenades “ Last time I checked, grenades weren't guns. “any weapon I do buy requires a waiting period, registration, and possible denial of the weapon.” Have a look on this website, (http://www.stategunlaws.org/) and see just how many states keep records of gun ownership or purchases, require particular licenses, or even take ballistic signatures before purchase. The 'tick here if you're a psycho' box on a purchase form is not regulation, it's a farce. “its the percentage that matters.” 89.5% of murders in the US are committed using handguns. “More people die of car crashes than guns, or cigarettes, or alcohol abuse.” But, as I stated in my first argument, guns are the only objects in that list designed to kill or injure people, and are bought by many people to achieve that end.";9;0;2;Against.

No, that's the case now anyway - anyone can get hold of a gun really really easily.

In the UK, hardly anyone owns a gun, so most of the crime in the UK does not involve firearms - criminals don't feel the need for them. Thus, less people get shot.";9;0;2;Against.
2822;"gun control";"I'd written this a while ago, but I thought maybe it'd be interesting in terms of this debate: Guns are a powerful cultural symbol in America. Their place in the U.S. is firmly secured in the Bill of Rights, they feature in almost all action films and video games, internationally renowned organisations are set up in their sake and they are a defining feature of many American households. But should they be? The Bill of Rights was adopted on the 15th December 1791, but times have changed somewhat since then and perhaps it’s time to revise these antiquated laws. In 1791, America was still very much forming and the right to bear arms was more justified. Two main reasons for its introduction were the need to hunt and the need for a communal defense. But since hunting is no longer necessary and is now merely a hobby for which a permit could easily be given upon completion of a firearms safety test, and the U.S.A no longer has a militia system, these reasons are no longer valid. The original needs for such a right, then, are negated. So what place do guns have in modern America? Well, it’s hard to tell really. If there is no need for them to survive, perhaps they’re useful for warding off criminals and intruders. Most Americans who own a firearm would defend their right to own one on these grounds while ignoring the contradictory nature of this defense. If no-one were allowed to own a gun without a license (and if they weren’t so readily available), then the number of guns owned by criminals would decrease dramatically which would in turn diminish the likelihood of a serious violent attack in the first place. Even as things currently stand, the odds of a civilian’s gun being used to shoot a criminal are comfortably under one in a million. The odds, however, of that gun being used to shoot a family member (often a child fooling around) are well over twenty times that, and it’s easy to see why. There are an estimated 280 million guns in U.S. homes. 40% of households with children own guns. Of that 40%, 10% leave their gun in an unlocked part of the house, loaded with ammunition and no safety catch. Isn’t that just an accident waiting to happen? No: it’s worse than that. Accidents are unforeseeable, but surely with such statistics tragedies are bound to occur. The sheer accessibility of guns makes it easy for anyone to kill. If, for instance, a row sparks off in the home, it is incredibly easy for tempers to flare for a split second, and yet a split second is all that is required to pull a trigger. It’s just so easy until we have to deal with the consequences. In this sort of situation (which happens more often than one would like to think) nobody is a winner: the shooter must live for the rest of their life with the weight of their reckless act on their shoulders and the victim is either seriously injured or dead. The psychology of younger generations also brings new risks. In tandem with the rise in media to include the internet, video games more realistic than ever and the mass production of films, firearms are now promoted more than ever. In fact, American culture has become so saturated with violent images that people have become accustomed to them. Thus it means less (or even becomes cool) to carry a gun or use it to threaten people. Also, the video games in which violence is a norm but has little consequence (eg. the characters have infinite lives, can survive 20 bullets and can be restarted with the touch of a button) can’t help their players to understand the fragility of life. In this virtual age, maybe children - future citizens - have forgotten the reality: that life is ended very easily, and you only have one chance at it. Gun crime is also a large contributor to crime statistics in the U.S., so by rescinding the right to bear arms crime rates would drop significantly, undoubtedly affecting the economy. U.S. jails currently hold around 2,245,000 inmates at a cost of $23,183 per inmate per year. All told, that’s a total of around $52,045,835,000 per year. Fifty-two billion - that’s a lot. If gun crime were deducted from that total, it would be a considerable saving, a saving that could be taken off tax or put onto more useful things (such as the army, police force, medical research, charity). If we compare Britain to America, America kills 30 times more people with guns than Britain, and injures even more. In short, the primary role of guns in America seems to be to injure rather than to protect or survive. I hope that's been helpful or at least interesting!";9;0;2;Against.

Surely if it's so important that you're allowed rediculously powerful firearms you should be allowed to carry any sort of weapon, especially one capable of dealing with large numbers of heavily armed people you seem to implying you would face? Also, in theory rebelling against the government is an illegal act even if it is a corrupt establishment. So whether the weapons are legal or not is of no consequence, the act in itself would be illegal. But people would still rebell. (Whilst the US contitution implies the legality, in its own eyes, of bringing down an unconstitutional government by force, the government itself would most likely create severe restrictions on rebell actions if there was clear citizen unrest. Would a corrupt organisation really encourage its own overthrow? The illegality of these restrictions would only be on-par with the actions taken by the government to be considered corrupt and nunconstitutional in the first place, of course the government would try to quash rebellions.) In short, right now, these types of guns simply aren't needed. If they still exist (in the hands of the government, you impy, presumably the armed forces), then there will be black market trade. Thier use for the purpose you state would be illegal when carried out, and of course an organisation you would use them against would restrict them anyway. So whether they are restricted now makes no difference, when they are needed, they will be used with the same amount of legality and reason as if they were unrestricted now. Also, since it would be the armed forces that are in control of them, and not directly the corrupt politicians, and since there seems to be an ethos in the US of 'the People have the duty to overthrow a corrupt government', I fail to underatnd why the armed forces could not be considered the 'People' and how a corrupt government would prevent these weapons being used against them by the forces trained to use them in the first place? To summarise: They should be restricted now, but if needed thier useage then will be identical to thier usage if the act was carried out now.";9;0;2;"Yes, I believe that the government has the right to limit the types of guns available to the general"

407;"gun control";"I am not 100% comfortable posting on this side of the debate because of the way the premise is framed. My belief, and I think it is backed up by the facts, is that if guns are totally banned, then crime increases. If guns are relatively easily available to citizens who are proven responsible enough to handle a weapon, free of a criminal history, and checked for a history of mental illness then all crime goes down. The catch is that if guns are too easy to get, even the criminals or those driven to crime by sudden passion or mental illness can easily obtain the weapons neccesary to cause mayhem. Even though I am a proponent of private ownership of guns, I am totally supportive of reasonable waiting periods to minimize the occurence of "crimes of passion". Several states in the US have passed "right to carry" laws. These laws permit legal gun owners to carry a concealed weapon on their person at any time. In 2004, states with RTC laws, compared to other states, had lower violent crime rates on average. Total violent crime was lower by 21%, murder by 28%, robbery by 43%, and aggravated assault by 13%.9. Many like to contrast the US violent crime rate with that of Canada. The paper, "The Failed Experiment: Gun Control and Public Safety in Canada, Australia, England and Wales" , (http://www.fraserinstitute.org/shared/readmore.asp?sNav=pb&id=604), demonstrates that assumption is incorrect. In fact the paper shows that over the past decade, the rate of violent crime in Canada has increased while in the United States the violent crime rate has plummeted." I have also often read about the low level of violent crime in Great Britain. A new study suggests the use of handguns in crime rose by 40% in the two years after a recent weapons ban was implemented. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/1440764.stm";9;1;2;"Gun control would greatly reduce crime in the United States."

When I think “gun control” I think of having limitations on having guns…where as “no guns” means no guns…If it was possible to completely eliminate guns in the US I believe violent crime would reduce sharply, not to mention accidental deaths. Sure, hunters would be upset, but maybe going back to using the weapons of the original Americans (bow and arrow) would increase the challenge and reward of hunting. Realistically, the first step should be tighter gun possession/purchasing laws. And crimes involving guns should have even greater consequences than they do now.

A gun in your home is 43 times more likely to kill you (suicide) or a family member than a criminal. Have I ever purchased a gun? No, I am educated and can comprehend that the dangers are not worth the reward. If you want to live in the Wild West move to a developing country like Mozambique or Somalia… There are developing countries in which almost EVERY household has a gun and guess what, they still have extremely high rates of rape and murder. Yet, there are countries in which hardly anyone owns a gun and they have practically NO violent crime, their police don’t even need guns! So, is it a coincidence that all the countries that have high gun ownership rates also have high violent crime rates? And that countries with low gun ownership rates also have the lowest violent crime rates….I don’t think so You want to defend yourself, try defending yourself from ignorance… make sure your children graduate from high school and go to college.

The second amendment flat out does not pertain to the regulation of who can sell guns, to whom they can be sold, for what purposes, who can buy them, where guns can be taken, etc. The aforementioned criteria are all essential parts of gun control.

3320;"gun control";"Well, let's take a look at the situation in colonial America. According to Gary Nash, in the early 1770s the top 5% of taxpayers in Boston controlled approximately half the taxable wealth. This was the case in other cities as well. Also, as a result of the Stamp Act, an infuriated mob destroyed and pillaged Thomas Hutchinson's house, and many other such anger-inspired events occurred, evidence of the widespread irritation concerning the massive gap between rich and poor. Given that the colonies were quite lucrative for the British rule, people such as the fifty-five constitutional delegates realized that the British empire had a greater need for the colonies than the colonies did for the Brits. I don't view the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the later framing of the Constitution as a completely altruistic action on the part of the founding fathers. I'm not by any stretch of the imagination suggesting some sort of preconceived conspiracy to mislead the colonists for their own self-enriching purposes, however, it seems to me that the elite colonists who wished to break away from Great Britain saw the anger in many of the colonists as an energy that could be harnessed, hence the creation of the Constitution. Nonetheless, I'm sure they also realized that this anger could bite them too if they weren't cautious. Where am I going with this? Well, given the anti-elitist sentiment on the part of many colonists, I think the more elite among the revolutionaries were less trustful of the prospect of armed masses, unless under their command, as many were during the Revolution. Perhaps the one exception would be Jefferson, stating that there should be "a revolution every twenty years." Therefore, I come to the conclusion that the second amendment applies only to the prospect of a well-regulated militia, emphasis on "well-regulated". Then you must also take into account that the framers never could have anticipated what the political climate would be 221 years and one day in the future. Let's assume that the drafting of the U.S. Constitution was entirely altruistic, and that the second amendment does guarantee individuals the right to firearms outside a well-regulated militia. How would anyone back then have predicted the emergence of Uzis, Kalashnikovs, and the like? If one truly believes that allowing the government to regulate the sale of firearms violates the Constitution, then these sorts of weapons, in addition to more dangerous ones such as tanks, artillery, RPGs, and others should also be allowed for civilian purchase. After all, if there was some sort of doomsday scenario of government oppression, these sorts of things would be much needed by the citizenry. In sum, I think it makes more sense that the second amendment applies to right to form a militia, and even when interpreted as an individual right, doesn't appear to prohibit any regulation.";9;0;2;"For Gun Control"
3320;"gun control";""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." Let's interpret it your way, that it guarantees individual Americans the right to own a firearm, despite my disagreement with that. Regulating the sale of firearms doesn't in any way infringe on the right to bear arms. One still has the right to own a gun even if there's a 30-day waiting period. Just because you can't go out and buy a mini Uzi doesn't mean you can't purchase a hunting rifle. Just because you can't carry a pistol onto certain campuses or specified buildings doesn't mean you can't store a legally-purchased gun at home.

This is an argument as to why citizens should be active in government. Rather than people fearing the government, the government should fear the people. Only a passive, non-active public will have their rights trampled by an overreaching bureaucracy. And if stricter gun control measures are implemented, this isn't necessarily an indication of potential government oppression, especially if the public sees fit to support such measures. As for the militia, there were state militias until 1903, so I would view it as pertaining to these state militias, especially since the state would be an entity capable of organizing a "well-regulated" militia. This would appear to uphold the principle of states' rights that the framers intended. Finally, with regards to machine guns, we have to think seriously about this. Do we really want a society in which people can acquire machine guns? Will that really make us safer? I think the more militarized we become, the less safe we are.

As far as how we would implement major restrictions on gun ownership, when there are so many guns and when we have the highest homicide rate in the industrialized world, I admit that it would have to be done slowly and carefully. We would have to phase out gun sales, while stepping up raids and gun seizures against criminals. However, this could certainly be done, and it is the only morally defensible thing to do.

No. Why is it that individuals generally equate guns with evil convicts who are out to rape and murder? I would not disagree that we should be more concerned with our daily lives than the unlikely event that there is a terrorist attack, but this begs two questions, would being prepared for one not help with being prepared for the other, and would gun control truly help prevent someone from committing a crime or does it merely remove one possible means of defense from a potential victim?

The Mayor himself stated that he did not expect it to be effective, but wanted it to start a dialog. Another example of silly laws, in Chico CA it is illegal to have a nuclear weapon within city limits, furthermore, there is a $500 fine for detonating a nuclear weapon within city limits.

You are either truly interested in learning from Irish conflict (in which case I appluad your common sense) or you don't know much about what occured (in which case I'm astounded by your folly). The terrorist situation in Ireland has gone through many phases and was finally brought to its current resolution 10 years ago (a resolution that looks like it will last). The way that resolution was brought about could (and probably should) be used to inform current US foreign policy on the fight against terrorism (with some tweaks), but unfortunately the current/past (this debate could last more than the fews weeks they have left) US administration seemed intent on making the same mistakes in the Middle East that Great Britain originally made in Ireland before actually solving the issue. As Winston Churchill said, "You can always count on the Americans to do the right thing, after they've exhausted every alternative" (or something to that effect), it seems the Brits weren't exclusive from that quote either. Interestingly enough, it was the Conservative policy of throwing Armed Forces, Special Forces and empowering armed Loyalists that turned the Irish issue into the bloodiest terrorism conflict that Great Britain has ever seen. It wasn't until Tony Blair and his Liberal policies on removing Armed Forces from Ireland and supporting devolution that the conflict was resolved and the terrorist attacks ceased. So, does throwing guns at the problem of terrorism work? Apparently not. Additionally, another key turning point in the fight against terrorism in Ireland was the Gun Amnesty, inviting both the IRA and Loyalists to remove guns from their society in an effort to stop the violence... guess what, that worked too.";9;1;2;"No - it is the police who failed here, not 'gun control laws'"

"I don't think you realize your own internal conflict on this issue 011235813, you claim that you are "not in favor of gun banning laws," but within the very same paragraph you go on to state that "we need stricter laws about... which types of weapons should be allowed."

Because if you say that some types of firearms should not be allowed then you ARE in favor of laws which ban guns. There just isn't any way around it. " Now that I read that again I realize it sounds very hypocritical, let me clarify. I think that guns in general should not be banned. If you want a gun for self defense reasons or hunting or anything along those lines, than it is your right. I do think there should be laws about the storage of these weapons. Locked up hunting weapons, self defense weapons, out of reach of children etc. Also some guns should be banned. There is absolutely no reason a civilian would need an AK or sniper rifle or any weapon designed solely for the purpose of military operation.

1251;"gun control";"Accidents do happen, I personally know friends who have lost a child because their firearms were not properly locked up. Laws regulating the storage of firearms are all but impossible to enforce unless we adopt a police state. Also, how would a firearm which is owned for self defense be able to fulfill its intended role if it is locked in a safe? Any laws controlling gun ownership is by definition unconstitutional. I am a fervent supporter of firearm education for all, this way negligent discharges can be mitigated. Proper training on the use of these tools is very important to ensure safety for all. I disagree with your statement that "there is no reason a civilian would need an AK or sniper rifle," the AK that you are undoubtedly thinking of is the legal semi-automatic version of the Kalashnikov. These are no different in their functionality than is the hunting rifle that you see no problem allowing. Currently the United States Army uses rifles based off of hunting rifles to fulfill sniper requirements. It all boils down to the user and not the tool. A gun is an inanimate object that can no more be a killing machine than a spoon without the person holding it in their hands. Obviously this argument does not take into account Terminator. ,-)";9;1;2;"No - it is the police who failed here, not 'gun control laws'"
3640;"gun control";""Also, how would a firearm which is owned for self defense be able to fulfill its intended role if it is locked in a safe?" I did not say to lock self defense firearms in a safe. I just think they should be kept out of reach of children, and the children should be properly educated about the firearms and their hazards. It is illegal to use military weapons for hunting, if the AK to which you referred was redesigned as a hunting rifle, than that isn't the point. There is no reason to own any sort of gun with no purpose but to harm other people. "Currently the United States Army uses rifles based off of hunting rifles to fulfill sniper requirements." That's all well and good, but it doesn't mean we should take the actual sniper rifles and go hunting. I'm fairly sure that that would be illegal. Again a hunting rifle is a different weapon than a sniper rifle, whether or not one is based on the other is irrelevant. "Any laws controlling gun ownership is by definition unconstitutional." I think that this is definitely debatable. The second amendment give Americans the "Right to Bear Arms," I agree, hunting rifles, shotguns, and self defense weaponry is a right. However, sub-machine guns, machine guns, sniper rifles, etc. serve no purpose other than killing and/or injuring people. Why would anyone need to own one?

2053;"gun control";"orbistertius said "I don't think anyone argues that strict gun control will cause violent gun related crime to drop to zero." What a totally absurd misleading statement, with absolutely no basis in fact. I posted the below on another debate, but it applies here. Sorry for its length. It is as concise as I could get it Guns are tools of protection and self defense. "Firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives." Why would anyone tale away the one thing that gives the peace loving law abiding an advantage over or at least equal footing to the evil and violent? No peace loving does not have to mean voluntary victim. If your assumptions are right than why does Washington DC which has a virtual ban on all guns consistently have the highest murder rate in the nation? While Vermont the safest state in the Union has no gun control laws permitting any adult to purchase any gun they wish and carry it as they wish without a permit license or waiting period. In study after study the evidence shows that states with the least restrictive laws regarding the ownership and carry of guns by law abiding citizens are the safest. Many researchers no most researchers who study guns and their effects on society like Lott and Kleck were pro gun control advocates prior to their research. After their studies did a complete 180. Coming around to support even advocating law abiding citizens civic duty to carry a gun. There are in fact many studies of countries that have banned gun completely that do show that after a dramatic increase in gun violence immediately following the gun bans. There is a significant drop in gun violence, after a few years. There have been claims that in countries that ban guns, there is a marked drop in gun violence. Recently those studies have been exposed as being inaccurate and distorted to support the gun bans. But lets accept that they are true. That gun bans do reduce gun violence. I can accept that as fact. But the statement is misleading because violent crime, rape, armed robbery, murder, and assault with a deadly weapon increased dramatically. Even double and still rising. In England teachers, even students are required to have bullet proof vests actually knife resistant vest. Because knife and sword attacks are now so common. In fact England has recently outlawed Samurai swords to go along with their gun ban. Kitchen knives and scissors are sure to follow suit shortly. FBI surveys reveal convicted criminals stating that they avoid victims that they think may be armed. Maybe that is why most criminals support gun control. Every state that has passed laws permitting concealed carry has seen dramatic drops in violent crime. Maybe we don't need studies maybe some common sense will work. Lets look at some facts I think we can all agree on. 1) Criminals do not obey the law. That is why they are criminals 2) Criminals as a whole are lazy. Maybe another reason they are criminals, demanding prosperity without effort. 3) So it follows that criminals seek out victims / prey not opponents. Armed citizens are opponents. 4) It is for that reason that most all mass murders occur in so called "Gun Free Zones". Only the criminals have guns in those areas 4) Less restrictive gun control means more law abiding citizens could be armed. Which means what to the criminal? I agree this is 2009 we should be far more evolved as a society. We should not have to need to defend ourselves from violent predators. Personally I run from fights and avoid bad areas and do all I can to avoid being a victim. Most gun owners I know do. I do not like packing a two pound pice of steel on my hip everywhere I go. I would have preferred to go on a cruise with my beautiful loving wife rather than spend the money on training courses guns and ammunition. God knows she deserves it. Heck I'd rather go on a cruise instead of paying for insurance too. But she deserves to be safe even more. Like my insurance, seat belts, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors I hope I never ever have to use my gun. There is a good chance I won't but I would much rather have it and never need it than need it and not have it. My niece did not think she needed one. She was right she didn't until the night she was dragged into a van where they kept her for four days and nights. A once stunningly beautiful young lady now covered with scars from knife wounds and cigar burns inside and outside of her body. The scars in her soul will never heal. She will never be the mommy she so wanted to be. She loved children so much that is where she was that night, working with under privileged kids. To this day she regrets not taking me up on my offer to a gun and training sooner. Today, she knows that the woman laying in the ally raped and strangled to death with her won panties is NOT morally superior to the woman explaining to the police why the rapist has two holes in his chest is. No that could never happen to you, it could not happen to her either. I'll close with some facts you can easily verify with a google search. Its is how I found them. Unlike the mass murders we have all read so much about armed citizens have managed to do what the police have never been able to do stop many mass murders. February 12, 2007, In Ogden Utah: Kenneth K. Hammond carrying a concealed weapon stopped a massacre at the Trolley Square Mall in Utah December 11, 2007, In Colorado Springs Colorado: After killing two people at a mission training school the killer drove 65 miles killing two more people in the parking lot before entering New Life Church carrying a rifle, two pistols and a backpack holding more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. intent on killing all 1,000 members inside the church. Which he would have done had Jeanne Assam not been there with her legally carried handgun. Jeanne Assam a member of the congregation (not a security guard as the media erroneously reported) stopped the killer before he could begin his massacre January 16, 2002, In Grundy, Virginia: Tracy Bridges & Mikael Gross stopped a mass murder at Appalachian School of Law, after lives were lost while they retrieved their guns from their cars, where they were required by policy to keep them. ( If college students legally licensed to carry concealed weapons been able to carry gun on school property no innocents would have died) 1998, In Edinboro, Pennsylvania: Restaurant's owner, James Strand stopped a killers rampage in Edinboro, Pennsylvania saving the lives of 240 students at a school dance a full eleven minutes before police arrived. One teacher John Gillette, 48, was killed October 1997, In Pearl City Mississippi: Principal Joel Myrick stopped a slaughter at Pearl High School with his .45 after lives were lost while he retrieved his .45 from his car, where it was required by law to be kept. (Had legally licensed school principles and teachers been able to carry his gun on school property none would have died) Obviously there is a pattern. Only those places that had an legally armed citizen were able to stop the rampaging mad men. The police were unable to stop a single killing not one. Nor is it reasonable to expect them to. They will only arrive in time to pick up the bodies. Isn't it about time to start looking at what works what saves lives? Stop creating law and policy based on what feels good and base our decisions on facts. On what works to save human lives *Guns are used 2. 5 million times a year in self-defense. Law-abiding citizens use guns to defend themselves against criminals as many as 2. 5 million times every year or about 6,850 times a day 20. This means that each year, firearms are used more than 80 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Of the 2. 5 million times citizens use their guns to defend themselves every year, the overwhelming majority merely brandish their gun or fire a warning shot to scare off their attackers. Less than 8% of the time, a citizen will kill or wound his/her attacker. (Kleck and Gertz, "Armed Resistance to Crime) * Anti-gun Clinton researchers in a effort to discredit that study claimed that firearms used in self defense saved ONLY 1. 5 million lives a year. According to the Clinton Justice Department, there are only 1. 5 million cases of self-defense with a firearm every year. The National Institute of Justice published this figure in 1997 as part of "Guns in America" a study which was authored by noted anti-gun criminologists Philip Cook and Jens Ludwig * As many as 200,000 women use a gun every year to defend themselves against sexual abuse. (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Armed citizens kill more crooks than do the police. Citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as police do every year (1,527 to 606) (Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America,) * Only 2 percent of civilian shootings involved an innocent person mistakenly identified as a criminal. The error rate' for the police, however, was 11 percent, more than five times as high." (George F. Will, "Are We a Nation of Cowards'?," Newsweek) * Concealed Weapon Permit holders are the single most law abiding segment of the population. More law abiding than doctors, judges, law enforcement and ministers (From FBI crimes statistics) As I have said in a perfect world this would not need to be a topic of conversation, there would be no rage hate greed and selfishness. Ideally we could keep guns away from criminals. Than there would be no need for guns. But this is not a perfect world and the laws based upon ideals has only managed to take guns away from the rational and law abiding. Causing all of us to be out gunned unarmed and defenseless in the face of evil. Maybe it is time to make laws based on the realities of 2009 and support the rights of law abiding citizens to defend themselves. Maybe it is time to do something we know works. Maybe it is time to take some personal responsibility and accountability for our won safety and well being. Stop demanding that the state and the police do the impossible. Maybe it is time for the criminals to be afraid";9;1;2;"No - it is the police who failed here, not 'gun control laws'"

We shoot someone entering our house illegally, we get sent to prison for 15 years and the victim gets a house with state income benefits. What I have said is, obtaining illegal guns and using them is one thing, but getting hold of legal guns and using them in crime is quite another. It is giving criminals a helping hand. You can walk down a street in the UK and be confident you won't be shot. (You will probably be stabbed, axed or sliced to death lol but...) However, you allow nationalisation of guns and that would disappear, you would fear some kid has got hold of his dads gun and you give him a wrong look and you get shot. That is how the UK works. Brining in guns has no evidence to support a DECREASE in crime, so until you can provide that evidence than you can't really stand there and say guns lower crime and no guns raises crime. It is no different to the death penalty- people have been brought up to believe it is a deterrent, when actually murders are higher in death penalty countries by 60% than those of non death penalty countries. Where is your evidence to suggest that guns lower crime? There is none. Most murders are committed on the spur of the moment out of rage, depression, jealousy. They would grab their gun and shot someone then regret it. Ban those guns and unmeditated murders would decrease. Yes they may well use another instrument to kill someone, but at least they didn't use a tool ONLY used for killing that they LEGALLY owned. Guns have one use- to kill. Why legalise something that's only use is to take another persons life? Most people can't even fire a gun straight anyway, if the government did become oppressive then the death of people firing a missed bullet and then being slaughtered would rise a thousand fold. The French, Dutch, Danish, Norweigen s, Belgians did a good job of interrupting the Nazi supplies etc without just shooting people. You do that you die. You avoid the guns and find other means then you live to fight another day. In the terms of the US- If your government became oppressive then first thing it would do would be to confiscate personal firearms. You could stand at your window shooting at soldiers who come to clear your house of guns all you want, you will run out of bullets, or they will just blow up your house and move on.

Also if you look at anti-gun areas in the United States (where liberals live) then look at crime. Yes, they are professional victims.

One Georgia town has a law making it mandatory to have a gun in each home, and what is the result? Yes, absolutely no crime since that law was passed. As far as limiting their possession, we can't seal off our borders, we can't prevent drugs from getting into the country, so therefore we cannot keep illegal guns out of this country. So, this is the very reason why we should not keep guns out of law abiding citizen's hands. Out of my 17 years in law enforcement I have never recovered a legal gun from a crime scene or arrested someone with a legal gun (with the exception of a few domestic violence suspects).

Children, not having the same decision making and temper controlling skills as adults, may murder someone because of something very small, such as getting on his nerves, or calling him something bad.
