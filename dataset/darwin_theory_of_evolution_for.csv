32,evolution,"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument.
Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world.
Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.",7,0,Evolution

448,evolution,"This is a non-argument. The earth is not 10,000 years old and dinosaur bones were not put here to 'test our faith'. Religion has been putting forth explanations as to the origins of the universe since humans have even begun to think about it. We dont need those old myths anymore about dead gods and fairies, humanity has come up with a quantifiable way of testing our hypotheses. Now, i will not sit on my ivory chair and say that science gives absolute facts, (i dare you creationists do the same) it is a process by which we can evaluate data and come up with a better understanding from that process. Nothing is ever fact, but we can come up with a good idea of what information to trust because of scientific rigor. Thank you and goodnight.",7,0,Evolution
21,evolution,"Oh come on, are you kidding me? Are ou trying to tell me that a magical man who lives in the sky and is invisible except for people that have died can see him in the magic white puffy village called Heaven? I hardly believe this; especially since if creation is how we were made, how was "God" made? Obviously evolution makes more sense.

510,evolution,"The problem with supporting any religiously founded theory against science is: which religion do you believe?
Chiristianity teaches one thing, hinduism teaches another, odinism teaches another and the peoples of various african tribes believe differently to each other. Why is any one view on how man was created more valid than any other?
That's right, it isn't.
Evolution is a plausible theory, supported by boundless evidence that seems to have very few chinks.
I know faith is not meant to be based on evidence, but I can't see why in the face of such a huge amount of evidence to the contrary faith is still used as a solve-all to a non-existant problem. We're pretty sure where men came from now, so there's no need to invoke the Sky Daddy, the ever shrinking 'God of the Gaps' in this instance.",7,0,Evolution
1221,evolution,"It is important to understand that evolution is both a fact AND a theory. The current theory, based on Darwin's research, describes the facts of evolution, as based on verifiable evidence.
If another theory comes along to better explain the mechanism(s) of evolution, it wouldn't nullify the fact that evolution occurs; things will continue to evolve.
A great parrallel is Einstein's theory of gravity replacing Newton's - gravity didn't cease to function or behave differently when the theory was updated based on our improved understanding - that's what is great about science. It is open to skepticism, looks to be challenged and replicated and verified - but all the while basing everything on evidence.
That is one thing creationism lacks. And to believe in something for which there is no evidence or proof is just intellectual dishonesty.",7,0,Evolution
1221,evolution,"I would be interested to see you cite your references for your comment that "a large amount of science communities believe in a creationist version of evolution." I would wager that not a single evoutionary biologist believes that.
It's important to understand that evolution is NOT an explanation for the creation of the universe. That is still a great mystery, but we're making progress everyday via science in our understanding of the origins of the universe.
Just because science can't explaing something now, doesn't mean a supernatural being can. There have been many things over the centuries that were once unknown or misunderstood that science eventually was able to explain (the source of lightning, gravity, what the sun is made of etc.)
And just because you need to lean on a supernatural explanation for something because science has yet to explain it or it's hard for you to believe, doesn't make that supernatural explanation true. Provide evidence to support that belief, and I'll change my stance :)",7,0,Evolution
812,evolution,"Define "order and detail." Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," and equally well written.",7,0,Evolution
1203,evolution,"Your main point is irrelevant.
If creationism just explains the "moment that started it all," then it is compatible with evolutionary theory. This is because evolutionary theory is a theory concerning the origins of complex organisms that we find today. It is not a theory about the origins of life in general, and it is certainly not a theory about the origins of simple microorganisms. (It is also not a theory about the origins of the universe.)
Evolutionary theory is perfectly compatible with the claim that some divine creator "touched" some primordial bog and out sprang a batch of microorganisms. Evolutionary theory is only committed to saying that life as we know it today is the result of these simpler organisms being subject to mutation and selection pressure.
I don't see any urgent need to address your claim that "evolutionary theory" is problematic because it gets to change its story whenever it runs into trouble, because it isn't clear to me that you understand what evolutionary theory is. But I will say something about it briefly. "Evolutionary theory" is a general theory about how life as we know it came about, and there is no real evidence against it. You should think of evolutionary theory as being analogous to the scientific view that matter is made up of smaller things (e.g., atoms). Lots of theories about atoms have been proposed, and most have been false. But this doesn't refute the general theory that matter is made up of smaller things. Similarly for evolutionary theory. My guess is that you are confusing some particular theory about the origins of some particular organism (or part of an organism) with evolutionary theory, but that is a mistake.",7,0,Evolution
1221,evolution,"It's interesting that you mention Charles Lyell when arguing for the case of creationism, as he was a close personal friend of Darwin and was one of the first prominent scientists to support Darwin's book "The Origin of Species" (TOoS) - although he never fully accepted the idea of natural selection. Lyell even offered an endorsement of TOoS in one of his own books.
As for the suggestion that there is no scientific rigor in evolutionary theory - have you read TOoS? Are you aware that scientists and others have been trying (rigorously?) to refutre or rebuff Darwin's theory for the past 150+ years and have yet to be able to do it?
And P.S. - dating rock strata is not evolutionary theory, or even related. That would be the field of geology - evolutionary theory was/is the cornerstone of the field of biology as we know it today.",7,0,Evolution
32,evolution,"Wait a minute. Sure, an ape is concrete. But evolution isn't. The ancients believed in God, and I'm sure they also believed in apes. God is not really that abstract either. Unbelievable, yes. But abstract, not really.
It seems quite natural for ancient peoples to have believed in supernatural forces in order to explain lightning, thunder, fires, floods, etc. However, I'm quite sure the first peoples didn't think "Hey! God just made some lightning strike!". They probably revered these natural phenomena as being supernatural. As language was acquired, they put names to their supernatural beliefs, and along came the gods.
Evolution is not an easily observable process, but it can be observed. When and where can God be observed? When does he "show himself"?
If the story of Adam were indeed true, OF COURSE he would say God created him! He chatted it up with God on numerous occasions in the garden? (Also, I'm quite sure there were no apes in that region of the world.)",7,0,Evolution

32,evolution,"There is even embryological evidence of evolution. The human embryo goes through certain stages where it has a tail-like appendage, as well as a primitive gas bladder-like structure (ie. fish have these.)
Many religious people shy away from evolution because of the "We came from ugly apes?!?" syndrome. Well, we also come from really very ugly embryos.
If we are made in God's image, perhaps he resembles a large embryo. Many animals look almost identical at the embryonic stage, so maybe there's a message there. (Yes, this is the kind of science creationists like!) God created us and the animals; we and the animals share a common look when we're quite young; therefore God looks like an embryo.

1217,evolution,"Evolution is a man doing a very big jigsaw puzzle.
Creationism is a man looking over his shoulder who thinks that the puzzle can't be done.
Evolution has hundreds of pieces connected, he can see a lot of the picture already.
Creationism points out pieces that don't fit, and tells him that he should give up doing the puzzle if pieces don't fit.
Evolution looks harder at those pieces to find where they do fit, because he knows they must fit somewhere.
Creationism says he'll never find where they fit, because they’re from a different puzzle and he's making the wrong picture.
Evolution looks at the almost complete monkey's face, the almost complete banana, the almost complete words "L*OK, I'M A HAIR* LIT*LE M*NK*Y!" and frowns.
Creationism says "It's a picture of God, and the words should say "God did it."”
Evolution carries on with the puzzle.
Creationism goes off to make his own puzzle and to bully jigsaw makers into putting bits of his puzzle in the same boxes as the one with the monkey.",7,0,Evolution
32,evolution,"As to whether _______, each person has to decide for themselves. Hmm... As to whether I can turn myself inside out and survive, I decide that I can! But wait a minute! Just because I decide that it's true, that doesn't make it true!!
So now, just because some religious folk look around and don't understand the natural world (like the cavemen didn't), and further because they don't even WANT to understand the natural world, there MUST be a god. Wow - I could claim anything this way. ("I don't understand how a computer works - God did it. I don't understand how an airplane works - God did it. I don't understand my homework - GOD!!")
So now a few billion years is a short time? Ok. So how many years would be about enough in your expert opinion?

32,evolution,"Wikipedia's article on "Recapitulation Theory" indicates that anti-evolutionists often use it to weaken support of eveolutionary theory. Sure, Haeckel's Strong Recapitulation Theory (ie. an embryo goes through every stage of a species' evolutionary history) is not believed to be true, but the article also states there are numerous connections between the growth of an embryo (ontogeny) and the evolution of that embryo's species (phylogeny).
Specifically, referring to my previous gas bladder point, the human fetal lung develops from an outpocketing of the upper intestines. The gas bladders of fish have evolved over time from sacs of the upper intestines. This is also true of terrestrial vertebrates; their lungs have evolved from sacs of the upper intestines.

32,evolution,"I think someone has already addressed your issue with scientific theories changing to accommodate evidence. There is nothing wrong with this in the realm of science. This is a great thing. If you've got something a bit wrong, or if you don't have the entire picture, bring on some new information. Sure, some scientists with big heads might reject modifications to existing theories, but if the modifications better explain the phenomena, those big-headed scientists will be dead someday, and science will win.
Let's talk about "change" in the realm of religion for a moment. I haven't seen a more changeable system in the history of the world. Talk about compliance and flexibility! Let's start with one of the oldest current religions: Judaism. So God told these people a bunch of things and everything was great. Then Jesus comes along with his shtick, changes a bunch of stuff. Then Mohammed. Then all of the changes in Christianity happen. You've got sects in Islam. A billion different Christian churches. If there is a God, he's pissed at every last one of you religious types who have ignored what he told the Jewish people (I'm not Jewish by the way). The first folks he spoke to must have got the correct story, don't you think? Anyhow, all I'm saying is that if there is a God, then we should all be fundamentalist believers, still in a 500 B.C.-type world.",7,0,Evolution
32,evolution,"I almost clicked "convinced"! Such a good argument! I think this debate shows that a number of humans on the right hand side are devolving. (kidding!)
However, aren't you aware that evolution can take a long time? In some species, it can be relatively quick, but in most it takes eons.
Do longer life expectancy and greater height in humans qualify as evolution?
If in fact humans are no longer evolving (but I'm not sure anyone could prove or disprove this), it could be because we've taken control over our environment. We have no real natural predators, and (ignoring some aboriginal peoples scattered here and there) we no longer live in a natural state.",7,0,Evolution
83,evolution,"Sean, I hear what you're saying and definitely agree with your point about evolution and Creationism not being mutually exclusive.
However, the old "this couldn't happen by chance" argument just doesn't work to defend Creationism, in light of recent scientific findings. Consider a crude version of the famous Drake Equation:
1. Age of universe: 13.7 billion years
2. Galaxies in universe: about 150 billion
3. Stars per galaxy: about 1 trillion
4. Planets per star: about 5
Just multiplying out these numbers would set my calculator to ERR: OVERFLOW. Basically, the point here is that life as described by evolution didn't necessarily have to happen on Earth, so it's ridiculous to confine our analysis to this one planet (especially given the gagillions out there!). When you consider the vastness of the universe, the odds don't seem so bad.
It's also important to note that Creationism is an argument that came from a time when humans believed the earth was the center of the universe (which consisted of the sun and a few other planets).",7,0,Evolution
32,evolution,"Why don't we have talking monkeys? What kind of a question is that? (Are all you creationists pulling your questions from a "How to argue with an evolutionist" pamphlet?) Why don't chickens migrate? Why don't polar bears live in Africa? Because they don't!! Species have certain characteristics and properties. Primates evolved from a common ancestor. Human primates are the only ones who evolved speech. And it's not because we got tired of making monkey sounds! You can't choose to evolve a certain characteristic. I didn't realize monkeys were oppressed. Sure they're hunted by poachers sometimes, but they can't simply decide to evolve speech and say "Hey! Stop hunting us please!"
You CAN see species in the process of evolving. Look around! Pick an animal. See - it's in the process of evolving. There are also some species of insects where we can witness evolution in very short time intervals.
Planet of the Apes? Can I hail an insult at you? Because this kind of point is so juvenile. Talking monkeys and apes warring against humans... Good argument...
Global warming: Again, you're totally confused about how evolution works. You can't just pick an environmental problem and suggest that humans should be able to actively evolve to combat it. However, it is quite possible that if radiation from the Sun becomes a huge problem, that people of certain skin types might be selected for survival and others not.
And again you misunderstand evolution. It is not a way to make humans better. It is not a method of making any life forms "better". It's a way for animals who are best suited to their environments to thrive.",7,0,Evolution

32,evolution,"I think you might have been referring to my tone. Yes, I get a little worked up by these arguments. Sorry if I offend.
However, I don't think standard "polite" argument is going to convince any creationists that evolution is true. Creationists have been brainwashed by forces in their childhood. From birth, they have been indoctrinated with false truths. To reverse this, they need to be shocked out of their stupour. Of course, what they really need are sessions with a psychiatrist, perhaps with shock treatment.
I think we might need to redefine Creationism for the purposes of this debate. Shouldn't it be limited to the appearance of humans in the historical record?

Have squirrels been the same for 10000 years? How about a million years?
Do you know anything at all about evolution? Have you heard of mutation? Selection? In the case of the insects I mentioned (the English peppered moth) we see selection at work. The moths were generally light-coloured and would blend in with the light-coloured lichen and trees. However, during the Industrial Revolution, the lichen died from pollution, and the trees were covered in dark soot. The light moths (which had alleles for dark wings in their genetic make-up) started being easily picked off by birds. This natural selection bumped up the percentage of dark-winged moths by a huge amount. Then as air quality improved the light-coloured moths increased in numbers.

32,evolution,"I am always amazed how creationists can explain away the wonders of the Universe with a simple "God did it".
We've got legions of scientists working on all of these questions. How did life start from a barren planet? How did the Universe come to be? How did humans appear? These people are actually trying to get to the bottom of these questions.
But then you have creationists and other religious types, who debase all of science, and even of humankind, by going down the lazy route. They ask a bunch of questions, but don't want to bother with the answers.
This has happened all throughout history. And Science has always come out ahead. Science has grown into an enormous explanatory machine, pushing religion into a tiny corner. I guess it's too much to expect this generation's group of religious people to change. But history shows us that their arguments and beliefs will vanish into thin air once the next generation's scientific discoveries occur.

The first formation of an organism from various building blocks? The first generation to "pass its genes" to the next? For these questions, Evolutionary theory has no answer."
Let me repeat what I said before: evolutionary theory isn't a theory about how life got started! Darwin was not theorizing about the origins of microorganisms. His theory is a theory about how complex life, as we know it today, developed. The question of whether man evolved from apes is not a question about the origins of apes. Similarly, the question of whether man evolved from tiny microorganisms is not the question about the origin of tiny microorganisms!

878,evolution,"You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection.

What if the dark colour appeared as a mutation at some point in the moth's evolutionary history? It stuck around in the genetic code but was rarely expressed. Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution.
If an organism's appearance changes due to external influences, that's evolution.
I don't think you're familiar with peppered moths, evolution, or science in general. Which is unfortunate.
You could also look at viral evolution, and bacterial evolution. Here, we humans are the external force causing the evolution with our anti-bacterial cleansers (selecting for the strongest bacteria) and our various medicines for diseases.",7,0,Evolution
32,evolution,"Many fewer dark moths were around than light-coloured moths.
The original peppered moth theory suggested that the light moths were much more visible to birds because of the darkening on their habitat. So in this scenario, the birds and Nature are doing the selection.

Again, it doesn't sound like you understand the basics of evolution. Please read about "natural" selection (and NOT from a creationism website.)
Unfortunately, it seems that the peppered moth example is not the best example. Although probably a case of natural selection due to pollution and birds, it's not as clear-cut as the original literature suggests.

It's one thing in this statement that irked me (it might not really be relevant to the point of the statement itself, but still); the use of the fact that exactly how proteins fold is as of yet undiscovered as an argument against evolution.
It had this effect me due to something I recently read in some 'scientific' magazine. Apparently creationism/intelligent design supporters were making a similar argument of this missing step in evolution. It seemed they were saying that they accepted the ideas of evolution up to the point of protein structure & the ideas about evolution & natural selection, etc. However, they (and nobody else) can as of the moment explain just how proteins fold, therefore (they concluded) there must have been some divine intervention in the folding. It just baffled me that anyone had the courage to claim something that ridiculous.
Certain religious ideas, or explanations for how things work, seem to be based on a principle of; "We don't understand something so it must be God's/something divine's doing." This principle in itself is practically saying that all we know now is all we'll ever know. Which science has proved wrong on countless occasions, as discoveries are made all the time.
Indeed, just because we can't explain something (protein folding in this case) with our current understanding of the process doesn't mean we won't tomorrow, or maybe the day after (or if we're unlucky, not in a long, long time).

Religious bias is much different. There is no evidence, only blind faith. What causes you to believe in "Jesus"? Why not the older Jewish religion? Or Hinduism? Why not the Greek or Roman Gods? There is no reason to believe in one of these religions and not the others. This is where childhood indoctrination comes in. If you were born in India, you wouldn't give two hoots about Jesus.

32,evolution,"It's not that I have a bias against God (how can I be biased against something which doesn't exist?). But I hold in contempt imaginary ideas which are given any sort of credence. Unfortunately, science is getting some God research done, however unsuccessful (see a recent Discover magazine). Statistically, I think it could be shown that God doesn't exist. You could look at groups of religious people and non-religious people and compare rates of suicide, happiness levels, illness, depression, criminality, etc. I'm sure you would find no difference. ‚hf there was a God, the huge communities of people praying for this and that would surely have an effect on society.
Science is trying hard to explain how the universe came to be, and is not providing any simple answers (like "God did it.") There is no obligation to do good in one's life, but let's hope that every sane person can see that society as a whole functions best when each of us does good. I don't need a god to tell me this.
As for whether there is more to our existence than our one life, this seems to be an instance of fear of death. The "do good and get to heaven" idea is very similar to "eat all of your veggies and get dessert". It's simply a way to con people into doing good, instead of expecting it to come from each individual themselves.
I don't "believe" in science, nor should you. Science is a method of discovery. You can practice it, you can read about it, but you shouldn't believe in it. Belief comes with a notion of permanence. If you believe in God, then that's it. The God shouldn't change to suit the whims of the current generation. God should be the same God as was a thousand years ago, nay, two thousand years ago! A progressive God doesn't make sense. God should know absolute truth and should have known it for eternity. All the religious people out there should be acting like the Mennonites.
Science, by its nature, is not permanent. Science constantly proceeds towards truth, sometimes making a few back or sidesteps, but always regaining its footing.
I am as amazed and enthralled by the mysteries of the universe as the next person. Was the Big Bang really the beginning, or has the universe constantly been expanding and contracting? Is there an edge to the universe, and if so, how can this be? Was there a beginning to time? All of these questions completely boggle the mind. Staring up at space at night and witnessing the vastness of it all is incredible.

If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time." 4.

One change in the ecosystem favored the large beaked morph over the small beaked morph, with the latter nearly becoming extinct. A second change in the ecosystem favored the now nearly extinct small beaked morph, and within a short time it was the dominant morph, with the large beaked morph on its way to extinction.

The effects of evolution can be felt in almost every aspect of our daily lives, though, from medical and agricultural dilemmas to the process of choosing a good mate. In medicine, there's the question of how long the antibiotics we take now will remain effective, given the relatively fast rate at which bacteria can evolve resistance to drugs. In agriculture, the need to protect this year's crops is pitted against the concern that doing so will set the stage for insects to evolve pesticide resistance.

259,evolution,"Creationism -- I am not an expert, but I believe that creationists claim that because of the complexity of the world(life forms, and the such), that an intelligent 'creator' must have designed things from scratch in order that everything may be complex. I do not think that creationists claim that god started evolution, but that god simply ordered these beings, as in the bible, to be.
Evolution -- Evolution is a theory that attempts to explain how all this complexity in life could have come about without invoking a creator god. Charles Darwin wrote the book, "On the Origin of Species" wich produced various evidences and arguments in favor of evolution. I have read the book myself, and thus I can also say that the book does not invoke chance to explain the creation of complexity. Also, many scientists of the time did not accept the theory until experimental verification of the theory added more evidence. Experiments, did add more evidence, to the point that many critical thinkers accept the theory as validated.
Both theories of Creationism and Evolution adequately offer good explanations for how complexity arrived in the world. Unfortunately, Creationism suffers from a small counterargument. Because creationism states that all life forms simply "came to be" by the divine will, we have a contradiction not with another theory, but with a scientific LAW that has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.
The second law of thermodynamics, and the law of conservation of matter states that matter and energy, while being able to convert to other forms, is NOT CAPABLE of being either CREATED or DESTROYED. It is not possible that life forms could have been created at the most fundamental level. Creationism, to be valid, would have to provide an explanation for how god was able to rearrange pre-existing matter in order to even be useful. I have no doubt that if a god existed, he could do such a thing. However, the theory of creationism, as claimed by creationists themselves, is the science of proving that God CREATED the universe. Unfortunately, creationism remains completely silent on HOW god created it.
Evolution, as explained in Charles Darwin's book, also provides an adequate answer to how complexity arose. The evidence is in favor of this theory, which is why it is at the top of the scientific community. The examples are in scientific archives, ect. Ask any well established scientist to explain evolution, and he could do it perfectly well. The only problem creationists seem to have with evolution, however, is that it explains complexity without recourse to God.
If we are examining whether creationism or evolution is the correct theory that explains complexity in life forms, then creationism produces a clash with the observed laws of the universe, and evolution does not.

Finally, your last statement about science providing whether science can provide meaning is a nonsequitor.

1246,evolution,"Every proposed instance of Irreducible Complexity has been refuted. For example, a potential explanation for the evolution of the eye was put forth in 'The Origin of Species' by Darwin himself, and there are living creatures that still have eyes using many of these earlier forms. Also, the bacterial flagellum, which Behe often put forth as a good example of Irreducible Complexity, has many similarities with the mechanism that viruses use to inject it's DNA into a host cell in order to replicate.
What is the difference between micro-evolution and macro-evolution? Biologists don't really use those terms, and creationists seem unwilling to define them. That may seem like a minor difficulty but it is essential for the discussion to move forward.

600,evolution,"We need to understand that the purpose of evolution is to not detect the scientific reasoning for the beginning of life on earth. As much though as the science world would love to know, evolutions purpose does not explain it.
Now you said that evolution does not explain where the common anscestor came from, how it all began. Well, that's not the point of evolution, evolution is and explanation of how we've changed in time. So in that sense, creationism and evolution don't compare, or rather even debatable as to which one is correct. One thing we can agree on is that creationism is a belief that explains how everything started, whereas evolution is a scientific theory explaining how everything changed. Now, you also stated that evolution, being a "scientific theory" can change at any moment as new information is discovered. Yes, that is true. A scientific theory is as close to a fact as it gets. For example, gravity. Gravity is a scientific theory. We know that it happens now, has happened in the past, we have some good evidence as to why it exists, but it could change as the earth changes, but all information points to the fact that gravity exists. I mean, 2+2=4 is a fact, that will never change, no matter what happens. Now take evolution, all scientific information has pointed in the direction that evolution exists, it can change at any time as we learn new things about it, but we do know that like gravity, it exists and has existed.
Evolution is complicated, but keep in mind, a lot can happen in millions upon millions upon millions of years.

So I hope i'm not forwarding the message to others that they shouldn't believe in god or something when I myself most surely do.
And yes haha, you are very much correct in saying that people on this website don't really have the "qualifications" to make any legitimate or reliable claims. Honestly, the only qualifications on evolution I posses are that of a few college classes on it, and that's it. So I myself am no expert. And i'm also no expert on the thoughts of creationism. Now, however, what I am certain of is that there is a very large difference between a scientific hypothesis and a scientific theory. To hypothesize is to observe something, assume something about it testing it to be true. Scientific theory is to observe, test it to the full quantity of its nature, and to come up with an answer that is correct, but could change as the earth changes in time. I mean, those men you listed, as credible and correct as they are (being the founding fathers of science as we know it today) can't change the fact that gravity and evolution fall under the same realm of scientific understanding and reasoning. An apple falls from a tree, well, a plant grows. A new apple takes its place, a differen looking one, a new offspring is born, also different. And i'm not sure how else to put it other than to state again, the purpose of evolution is to not understand how we began, but who we began from. As far as my understanding of creationism is concerned, that is the belief of how we got here, how anything is anything. A belief system I don't completely not believe in myself.",7,0,Evolution

That would be a better example of the two concepts intercepting and causing debate. Another time in which these concepts intercept and start large debate is when discussing if one or the other should be taught in school or not. But those are debates for other times. I think instead of "which is correct, creationism or evolution", it's a matter of understanding each and how they differ, how one is science-based, and one is faith-based, but that doesn't mean either are incorrect or wrong to believe.

I've asked people knocking on my door spreading the "word of god", what reason has caused the most wars and un-natural deaths in the hystory of the human race? and the answer is religion, those going out and fighting in the name of god or whatever other deity, even surpassing natural disasters (which were caused by god if you asked those who believe)

1191,evolution,"A BMW being formed randomly out of car parts is not comparable to the order we see in the Universe. You are incorrectly viewing the Universe (in its current form) as the goal of its existence. However, this is a fallacy. Let's take poker as an example. Any poker player would surely admit that being dealt a pair of aces would be far better than being dealt a two and a seven. However, despite the fact that a pair of aces is better than a 2-7, the odds of being dealt one or the other is exactly the same. You are making the assumption that the order you recognize is the end goal, when that is not the case. Take your BMW example: if you threw all the parts into a giant pile, and left it there for "millions of years," some order would arise (heavier pieces would perhaps shift to the bottom of the pile, weaker pieces would break and give way to stronger pieces, etc.). Whether or not the order you expect or view as the end goal (in this case, a fully built BMW) occurs is irrelevant, as some kind of order would arise.
The Universe could function just as well were it slightly different or even entirely different, it would simply differ from what you perceive to be the correct order.",7,0,Evolution
1191,evolution,"Let's go through your claims point by point, shall we?
1) Thermodynamics and the origin of the Universe
We may never comprehend how the Universe came into existence for a fairly obvious reason: You are correct in your definitions of the laws of thermodynamics. However, the rub is that these rules are only considered universal laws within OUR universe. Therefore, they have no bearing on what occurred prior to the existence of the universe. In other words, the laws of physics as we know them didn't necessarily apply when the Universe came into existence.
2) Biogenesis
Look at a simple cell. What are it's components? A hydrophobic phospholipid membrane enclosing a medium in which proteins are shaped according to chemical processes. In other words, inorganic components. "Life is just an extreme form of chemistry" (-Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson). Life is simply the complex chemical interactions that take place between inorganic components making up the whole. Even creationists must concede that we are in fact made up of inorganic materials (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, etc. are not themselves alive, as we define it). They seem to work together so perfectly for 2 reasons: you are (incorrectly) viewing life as we know it as the end goal, and because the processes that didn't work phased out of existence.
3) Design?
I'm not quite sure I understand this argument. Mammals are the only group that contain erythrocytes (red blood cells) that lack nuclei. Are you suggesting that all other vertebrates were designed with less thought?
4) Information?
Again, I'm afraid i don't fully understand this point. Apparently, the fact that our cells self replicate in large numbers is indicative of a level of "information" that suggests some kind of design? The differentiation of cells is a result of a set of genes known as the HOX gene set. They are responsible for correct segmentation of an embryo into its workable form. At first, this is very generalized (i.e. assigning dorsal-ventral orientation) but over time become more specific (i.e specific organ tissues). This process is very well documented, and is the reason that we are shaped the way we are. I hope I have adequately addressed this point. The "information" you view as impossible is quite well understood actually.
5) Instantaneous Systems
Your mistake here is assuming that these organ systems evolved at the same time or the same speed. Insects don't have a closed circulatory system (as we have), but they seem to make it alright on their own. You are once again viewing our species as it exists right now as the standard, when it is not. You also seem to be having trouble grasping the enormous amount of time it took for these systems to evolve. It appears that a simple heart in an open circulatory system (as insects have) was the starting point for our relatively complex circulatory system (although to a dolphin or whale, our circulatory system might appear quite primitive and ineffective).
6) Sex
Your view of this topic is quite flawed. There was never a point where a non-chicken gave birth to a chicken. That isn't how evolution works. It is such a slow and gradual process over such a long period of time that the shift from non-chicken to chicken wouldn't be perceptible. Take dogs for example- at what point during the domestication of dogs did they become dogs and cease to be wolves? You would certainly agree that a golden retriever is different from a wolf, but by just looking each generation from one to the other, you would never be able to point to a specific line and say, "This generation is golden retrievers while the one that gave birth to it was wolves." Once again, you seem to have trouble grasping the concept of very gradual change.
7) Transitional forms
Forgive me, but I'll use dogs as an example once again. Why are there no living examples of canines halfway between wolves and golden retrievers? Does this mean that no such animal ever existed? Of course not. Whether or not something is alive today doesn't have any bearing on whether or not it did exist (any extinct species is proof of that). Furthermore, Why is a platypus not a transitional form? It is the halfway point between mammals and reptiles (cleverly called areptile-like mammal). Additionally, There are examples of nearly every stage of our evolution, so in a way, they are transitional forms. There are nearly no gaps in the fossil record (astonishing in itself), and by their very nature, there would be not be many "transitional forms" found today, because they would have given way to modern animals. There is no wolf-golden retriever because we bred them into becoming golden retrievers.
8) Fossil Evidence
I'm sorry but you are simply incorrect here. To use your examples of dinosaurs, we have fossils of the first "bird" archaeopteryx- a dinosaur with wings (still had teeth and a long tail). Additionally, fossils have shown that dinosaurs such as velociraptors were covered in feathers (feathers and scales are very similar structurally. This is why birds often have scaly legs resembling those of reptiles). There are thousands of what you would call "transitional forms" in the fossil record, but for some reason creationists like to deny this fact. Many modern animals have complete fossil records, horses for example. We have complete records showing horses evolving from small, three-toed animals with longs tails into the animals we see today.
9) Genetics
I will simply dismiss this as another example of your inability to grasp how gradual the evolutionary process is. If wolves only have wolves, where did dogs come from? Why is every animal on the planet related?
10) Misrepresented statistics
Take your example of the alphabet. It is somewhat flawed and overly complicated, I hope you'll allow me to simplify it. Instead of letters let's say you had 6 dice. Your example is equivalent to saying, "roll 6 sixes all at once." Obviously, this is a tall order (odds of this occurring is (1/6)^6 or 1 in 46,656). However, a more accurate representation of evolution would be asking you to roll 6 sixes, but you have as many rolls as you like, and when you roll a 6, you don't have to reroll that die. It would take only a few rolls to reach the goal of 6 sixes (you can try this at home if you like). Evolution isn't the random coming together of traits. It keeps traits that work, and gets rid of those that don't.
I hope you do more research on your own, as all of your points are very easy to reconcile. All the "problems" that you have found have already been (often simply) explained. Please let me know if you think I didn't answer any of your questions sufficiently. Best of Luck.",7,0,Evolution

3) Although there are examples of things existing despite our not being able to see them (i.e. wind, magnetism, gravity, etc.), the difference between these and God is that unlike God, magnetism or gravity have observable and predictable effects on reality.

My second, and main issue, with your answer is the nebulous definition of the word "kind." You describe dogs as being a "kind," but even within dogs (I'm referring to the Family Canidae, not the species Canis lupus familiaris), interbreeding is not as simple as you seem to assume. For example, the African Wild Dog has been found to be unable to breed with any other species of Canid. Does that mean it isn't a "kind" of dog? I would very appreciate like a definition of a "kind!"
Furthermore, no animal has ever come from a phylogenetic line in which it does not fit (in other words, no animal has ever been born that is not related to all the animals that came before it), as in your example of a bird evolving into an alligator. That being the case, all dogs are found within taxonomic Order Carnivora, as are cats and bears. This is because all these animals are related to each other despite that fact that you would say that they belong to different "kinds."

The reason why religion is such a persistent theory the fact that these first idea's were powerful, remember any first experience of your own. Any idea put in your head as a child and then come to find it was wrong... it's hard to let go, these first idea's are powerful and people want to believe them. Not only this religion is a powerful tool, the idea that there is an almighty being that not only created life but can destroy it is a very persuasive tool to make people give money, time and behave in certain ways. This is a whole different subject but watch Zeitgeist then come back to me and tell me how you feel about this subject.
Right, diverged a bit there. I argue a whole new point, that creationism and evolution are both science and simply different theories. It is a persons right to choose one theory over another usually through the process of critical analysis and looking at the evidence available as well as the reliability of the process used to collect the evidence. However I agree with Dawkins that people who follow religion are taking the cop-out, I quote "Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence." Using this logic, I say evolution seems like the 'study' that is least flawed and has the least evidence against it. And to respond to drmack metaphor of a bmw, no it is unlikely a bmw could just throw itself together through chance, however many of the components of it did. Furthermore; not one of the components of a bmw is self replicating (which is a normal ability of a molecule if it's structure and chemistry allows it) thus they are not subject to external influences allowing certain variations (however small the difference be between individual molecules) to replicate more so than others. This process inevitably leads to more and more complex structures that are nothing more than a vectors of the replicating molecule (genes) and given the time life has had to evolve, I believe that it is VERY likely even the most complex biological structure has come about through what is essentially a chemical reaction followed by self replication. Quite a depressing, but liberating, outlook on life.
I feel by denying evolution, you are denying the basic workings of life such as chemistry. Do you think the factories that produce our detergents, medicines and fuel are decoys to test out faith and these are in fact provided by a superior being? I doubt it. How do you explain how we breed an animal for our exact needs? Are you denying that we are choosing an animal to breed with another to exasperate a characteristic? You can't, the production of a whole new breed of animal can be seen by a person in their life span.

case in point, ape and man DNA are 90+% similar. so what? i cannot scientifically conclude men came from apes. even if you add intermediaries, homo-whatever, even at 99.9% similarity, i do not see where the conclusion "came from" is derived. you are guessing, intelligent as it may be.",7,0,"evolution is unscientific"

"I realize there are creatures, that do both"
Well then, why can't the first fish ever to breathe air have been one of these? Why does it have to be one or the other? You seem to have highlighted the flaw in your own assumptions.
"Why adapt anyway?"
Ah, it is this that appears to be your central misunderstanding. Unless you assume that everything is created with an express purpose dictated by an outside force (and even if you do, this can still apply), it is reasonable to assume that almost everything is more or less happening at random. When a child is born, is it born to an exact model? Can we say that a human child has fingers exactly 'so' long? Not at all - it's all chance. You just need to look at the level of mutations that occur on a regular basis in new babies; so much can go wrong in the (highly complex) process of growing a new organism that the variation between individuals is often vast.
If, for one type of creature, a mutation that occurs fairly regularly proves to give the creatures carrying the mutation an advantage over those that don't (eg: the first apes with skeletons that allowed them to stand slightly more upright allowed them to spot predators more easily, and run quicker) then the creatures with the mutation will live longer, eat better, breed for longer and have more offspring. Over time then, the percentage of the individual creatures with the mutation will be increased, and the results will be compounded (eg: the apes that could stand most upright gained the most advantages, and so their offspring were more upright, then the most upright of those etc. etc. etc...). In this respect, human controlled animal is a perfect example - if you want horses with the best body structure for running, then you mate the best running horses available together - if you want dogs with long hair, you mate a long haired dog with another long haired dog. Yes, of course these 'advantages' are human induced, but its easy to see how a creature that can escape predators or find food better than its competitors has more offspring who are able to do the same thing than its competitor who can't.
Evolution is a simple process, and one that is easy to grasp once you spot how creatures interact with the world around them.",7,0,Evolution
3187,evolution,"Yeah, I realized that too now that I think about it. I phrased it wrongly. I should have said "which deserves more credence" or "which is a more conclusive theory" or something like that.

That is why I get so worked up if people who seem to actually understand the concepts use the words incorrectly. I get it...but it confuses many of those who don't even more.",7,0,Evolution
422,evolution,"The theory of evolution DOES NOT in any way, shape or form, not for ONE LITTLE MOMENT, claim that the diversity of species we see today came about by 'random chance'.
Many of the criticisms of this 'theory of evolution' stem from several really CORE misunderstandings of what the theory actually says.
So, for the record, the theory of evolution:
1. DOES NOT say that IT is TRUE. However, it is the BEST currently available scientific theory (strict, scientific meaning of the word 'theory') which explains the undeniably observed facts. As more facts come about, the theory will be refined and/or corrected to account for them - this flexibility is ESSENTIAL to the scientific nature of a 'theory'.
2. DOES NOT claim that the driving mechanism of change is random chance. To the contrary, it is clear that random chance IS NOT this mechanism. It asserts that what drives evolution is NATURAL SELECTION. The two are not even a little bit alike.
3. DOES NOT claim that humans have evolved FROM apes. Not even a bit. It claims that humans ARE apes: a very particular species of apes, called homo sapiens sapiens, but an ape none the less. What makes us apes? Our physical features! It is a scientific label that is applied to a specific group of life-forms which have certain things in common...like no tails and opposable thumbs, among others...
Before I get too warmed up, I will leave it here....with just one more caveat:
'Creationism' CAN be 'true' to many people on a spiritual AND/OR psychological level...it can be described as their 'true' perception of their 'specialness' and 'self worth'. And that is good - I, for one, would not question that.
However, it is misguided to think that 'creationism' (fundamentalist, few K years old-Earth version) is an accurate description, reflective of any physical reality (as we familiarly understand these terms).
Evolution is a scientific theory: as such, it is VERY EXPLICIT that IT is NOT 'the truth'!!!! ...whatever 'truth' may be.... To assert that is to NOT understand what a scientific theory is - or, indeed, the very point of one.
However, the theory of evolution is the most accurate description of our observed physical reality (within its reference frame - i.e.life-forms and their progression...it does not speak for 'physical reality' outside this) and how it has come to be into this current state.",7,0,Evolution
1961,evolution,"The debate should be about Evolution vs ID,not creationism. Unless we narrow down the debate, it is meaningless. It is like big bang theory to ID. Apples and oranges.",7,0,Evolution
1529,evolution,""we'd all be genetically "backward compatible". "
We are, but not by very much. It's a very, very slow process.
Since there is slight variation between all human beings, there has to be a certain degree of 'backwards compatibility' or more accurately 'cross platform compatibility' (since it is illogical to claim we are all at different points on a single straight line of evolution) for humans to be able to breed at all.
"There is not reason for them to be on land"
Seeing as we are talking about the first ever creature to take to dry land, where do you think that most, if not all, of its natural predators were? Land looks very safe when its your escape route from being eaten. Also, think about mud flats where tides rush in and out very fast - whilst little shrimp etc might be able to survive in the puddles left as the water retreats, the fish that eat them would probably die. Don't you think that a fish with even a rudimentary breathing ability would survive longer than those without, given these conditions?
"The problem is that said adaptation could not be adapted because said creature needs it to survive anyway."
You can list them if you want, and I'll continue to refute them. This will, I'm afraid, come down to me just researching individual case so I can reply to you personally - the information is already out there. I'm not scientist, so I'd appreciate it if we look mainly at the theory itself.",7,0,Evolution
2906,evolution,"90% of fundamentalist christians don't actually understand the proposals which evolutionary theory makes. On godtube.com I have seen christians in videos say things like:
"Evolution is the theory that over time all things will happen. That a rock will turn into a man; that a mousetrap will turn into a mouse."
[actual verbatim quote from 'chat with charley']
Now, not that this does anything to further support evolutionary theory directly, but it does mean that you cannot take the people who refute evolution seriously - overwhelmingly, most are just ignorant mouth-breathers. Which probably also explains why they're so heavily indoctrinated with religious beliefs in the first instance.",7,0,Evolution
2906,evolution,""Human DNA is similar to an apes, but this does not constitute any proof."
Certainly a lot more proof than creationism offers. How about this: The apes (orangutan, gorilla and chimpanzee) have 24 pairs of chromosomes. Humans only have 23 pairs. A hypothesis assuming common ancestry predicted that two of the chromosome pairs had fused in humans. And that's exactly what they found when they looked: http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html
"In fact, since evolution requires more advanced species have greater complexity, this would indicate the horse is more evolved than human (more chromosomes)."
Absolute rubbish. The number of chromosomes is NOT related to the intelligence or complexity of the organism. A crayfish has 200 chromosomes. Does that make it smarter or more complex than you are? No (although crayfish are probably slightly more intelligent than creationists).
"Mammoth is good example (turns out, not woolly and had tropical food in its stomach."
Doh! There were several species of mammoth. You are probably talking about the 'Columbian mammoth', which was definitely hairless and ate tropical fruit. You could also be talking about the Steppe mammoth from Eurasia, which is also thought to be hairless, or at least - there's no evidence for hair.
"This actually highlights a problem with evidence on both sides"
No, the problem is only on the creationist's side.
The scientific process is...
ideas/observations
hypothesis
experiment/more observation
data
conclusion
publish
peer-review
... after which the idea is falsified or strengthened over time by hundreds of thousands of people working in the relevant fields. OK, so the process is not perfect, but it's the best we've got towards finding out the realities of our universe.
Creationists have NEVER taken part in this process or published one paper to be peer-reviewed. Instead they make propaganda books, videos, and websites and pull political strings.",7,0,Evolution

Science knows that in a very real metaphysical sense, we cannot call anything 'truth'. That we can't 'know' anything as an absolute. Science intelligently avoids this word for the sake of accuracy and caution.
Yet, look at how religious people talk. The know the truth, the have the truth, the one and only truth, the only true god. They've felt the truth, experienced real truth, and have been enlightened with the truth.

For many years, I accepted naturalistic evolution as a given, a proven scientific fact. Even though I knew it was a theory, it seemed to make sense and explain the evidence. I participated in a field biology/ geology class in college during which a group of students spent over a month traveling around Colorado, learning the basics of scientific thought while stopping at road cut after road cut, digging fossils and seeing evolutionary evidence for ourselves.
Creationists, I thought, were the ones who lacked a commitment to truth and objectivity, who ignored evidence because of prejudice or a belief system they felt a need to defend. Whether I wanted to believe in God or not was irrelevant to what was true. My commitment has always been to truth, whether I like it or not. I accepted evolution because I was unaware of the sum total of evidence and because I didn't know the questions to ask. I don't think I ever completely believed that God was just a figment of men's imagination, but I didn't argue with those who did.
Almost twenty years after college, I listened to some tapes by creationists and was surprised to discover that they made more sense than I had expected. I decided to do more investigation. I read Origin of Species and dozens of books and articles on evolution and creation (view reading list and annotations). I searched out the criticisms each side had of the other and read the responses to those criticisms. My goal was to maintain an open mind and to consider all arguments without prejudice. To my surprise, I became more and more convinced that, although both sides had strong and weak arguments, natural evolution as outlined by Darwin can not account for what exists. This does not, of course, mean that the Bible is true, but it leaves the question open. According to biochemist Michael Behe, author of Darwin's Black Box:
The conclusion that something was designed can be made quite independently of knowledge of the designer. As a matter of procedure, the design must first be apprehended before there can be any further question about the designer. The inference to design can be held with all the firmness that is possible in the world, without knowing anything about the designer.
By the way, if any evolutionists read this and would like to open a dialogue, correct facts I may have gotten wrong, or present information that's become available since I did my study, I'd love to hear from you. I'm open to new information and committed to truth. In the course of my investigation, I tried to get my honest questions answered by evolutionists and was told not to get sidetracked by details. I should believe in evolution, I was told, because it is scientific. It reminded me of trying to get my questions about Christianity answered in high school. Then I was told I should believe the Bible because it is God's word. In both cases, no attempt was made to answer my questions. I was asked to accept prevailing thought based on authority alone.
Details are important. In criminal investigations, a tiny detail that doesn't fit can lead to a whole new line of inquiry. A person committed to truth and objectivity cannot afford to ignore or brush over details that do not fit his preconceptions.
Many serious scientists have always doubted the sufficiency of Darwin's theory, or have accepted it mainly because they couldn't think of a naturalistic alternative. For some quotations by famous scientists concerning the origin of life, click here. The evidence to support evolution is not overwhelming, as is often stated. I was surprised to find in my research that the same examples that were cited 30 years ago when I was in high school are still the best evolutionists have to offer: the peppered moth, sickle-cell anemia, etc. I had expected that by now there would be many more clear examples and much more "proof."
Below is a summary of what convinced me that natural evolution cannot be the answer to the question of origins.
Natural law. Scientists investigate the laws of nature. The very existence of law and order in the universe points to a source or lawgiver.
Law of cause and effect. All current scientific evidence indicates that the universe had a beginning. Before this evidence was found, many scientists thought that the universe had existed eternally and had no beginning. According to the law of cause and effect, every effect must have a cause. Since we have an effect (the beginning of the universe and life), there must have been a cause. That cause would necessarily be outside the present realm of nature.
First law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. In the current order of nature, energy is transformed from one form to another, for example from nuclear energy (sun), to light, to chemical energy (in plants), to heat (when the food is eaten and the calories are used to warm the body), to motion (walking) or sound (speaking). Electricity is an additional form of energy. Energy can never be created or destroyed. This is not a theory, it's a law. Matter is related to energy (e=mc2), so energy can sometimes be transformed into matter and vice versa, but the energy itself cannot be created or destroyed. Since we have matter and energy, and since the universe has not always been in existence, energy had to have been created at some time in the past. Today's natural laws must not have always been in operation.
Second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics describes the natural tendency of things to progress from order to disorder. This law states that order does not arise spontaneously from chaos. In other words, the universe is "running down." In the past, there was more usable energy in the universe than there is now. The same amount of energy exists because energy cannot be created or destroyed, but on the whole it is in ever less usable form.
The theory of natural evolution proposes that over millions of years, the universe and life on earth naturally proceeded from chaos (disorder) to the amazing degree of order we observe today. Although scientists argue that the excess energy of the sun could have powered these improvements without violating the law, evolution would have required not one but hundreds of millions of small movements "uphill". Even a single incidence of this would be unusual! Note that the apparent uphill movement of a seed to a tree or a fertilized egg to an adult animal is not random. The seeds contain the design code and instructions for "building" the organism from available materials. The question is, can information come from nothing? Can information organize itself in an orderly way?
Law of biogenesis. People once believed that maggots were spontaneously generated from the flesh of dead animals. They thought life could come from non-life. Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that life cannot arise from non-life. This is not a scientific theory, but a law. Proponents of evolution contend that life did arise spontaneously from non-life at least once in the past, in other words, that this particular natural law was broken or nonexistent sometime in the past.
Complexity of living cell. A single cell is far more complicated than any machine intelligent man has invented. A typical cell contains ten million million atoms (quadrillion). To reconstruct a model of a cell, atom by atom, one atom per second, would take about ten million years to finish. To get a cell by chance would require at least 100 functional proteins to appear simultaneously in one place. Even if that happened, would it be alive? A dead body (or a dead cell) has all of the proper proteins, enzymes, the cell wall, and the DNA design in one place, yet it is not alive.
Complexity of DNA code. The capacity of DNA to store information vastly exceeds that of any known system created by intelligent man. If the information in an individual's DNA were in small type in books like the telephone book, it would take a stack of books 46 feet high to hold all the information. Yet there is a DNA molecule in every one of the ten trillion cells in a human body. The design information to specify every person who has ever lived and every species of animal and plant which has ever existed would fit into a cup, with room left over.
Sexual reproduction. Evolutionists often point out that humans and chimpanzees share 99% of genetic material. Yet humans have 23 sets of chromosomes and chimps have 24. For two animals to mate, their chromosomes must match or "zip together." The proposed divergence of chimps and humans from a common ancestor is said to have occurred after sexual reproduction began. If the theory of evolution is true, an animal must have been born at some time in the past with a different number of chromosomes than its parents. Unless that animal was able to mate, it would have no adaptive advantage. Therefore, if evolution as proposed is true, two animals must have experienced the same change in the number of chromosomes in the same geographic location during the same generation. Although "coincidences" such as this have not been observed in nature, they must have happened thousands of times in the course of history if natural evolution is to account for what exists today.
Interdependence of proteins and DNA. The proteins needed for life cannot be manufactured without the design specifications of DNA. DNA cannot replicate itself without enzymes (proteins). According to atheist Richard Dawkins, "DNA and protein are two pillars of a stable and elegant arch, which persists once all its parts simultaneously exist. It is hard to imagine it arising by any step-by-step process unless some earlier scaffolding has completely disappeared." Such scaffolding is completely speculative.
Complexity of the brain. Microelectronics, created by intelligent man, can pack more than a million circuits within a cubic foot. The brain has been estimated to pack a million million circuits per cubic foot. The human brain contains about ten billion nerve cells, each of which can put out between 10,000 and 100,000 connectors. The number of possible associations, hence the number of potential thoughts a person can think, may exceed the number of atoms in the universe. The brain is by far the most complex thing known to man.
Probability. There are about 1070 atoms in the observable universe. There are only 1090 seconds in the 15 billion years generally said to be the age of the universe. The probability of spontaneously forming the smallest replicating protein molecule by chance is 1 in 10450. The probability of spontaneously forming proteins and DNA for the smallest self-replicating entity is 1 in 10167,626. The probability of a simple living cell reassembling itself under ideal natural conditions if all components were present but chemical bonds were broken is 1 in 10100,000,000,000. Mathematicians consider events in nature with a probability of less than 1 in 1050 to have a zero probability, i.e. to be impossible regardless of how much time is available.
Mutations. Mutations are errors in DNA copying. They are very rare and 99.99% of them are harmful or fatal. DNA has a built-in "proofreading" system with such accuracy that a typist would each have to type 20 billion books with only one typographical error for it to be matched. The neo-Darwinian synthesis proposes that mutations are the primary source of improved genetic material.
Natural selection can select from an existing gene pool that which is "fittest" for a particular environment. It does not even attempt to explain the origin of the material in the gene pool from which selections are made. Where did the huge variety of genetic information come from in the first place? Information must come from somewhere. It does not arise spontaneously.
Adaptation or "fit" of organisms to their environment. In many cases, many interlocking parts would have to come about at once for any mutation to be functional enough to be naturally selected. An example is the bombardier beetle. When threatened by an enemy, it blasts boiling hot gases from two tail pipes into the face of an attacker. The explosive is made inside the beetle's body by mixing together two dangerous chemicals (hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide). In addition to these two chemicals, the beetle manufactures another type of chemical known as an "inhibitor." The inhibitor prevents the chemicals from blowing up and enables the beetle to store the chemicals indefinitely. When the beetle is approached by a predator, he squirts the stored chemicals into the two combustion tubes and at precisely the right moment he adds another chemical (an anti-inhibitor). This knocks out the inhibitor and a violent explosion occurs right in the face of the attacker. How could such as system, utilizing such dangerous chemicals, have evolved randomly step by step? All parts are necessary for any of them to have an adaptive advantage. The probability of more than one advantageous mutation arising at once is incredibly slim.
Darwin himself wrote:
If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.
Convergence. The eye is an example of an extremely complex organ. Yet it is said to have evolved independently numerous times. Vertebrate eyes are imperfect. They're wired backwards and have a blind spot. Evolutionists argue that God would certainly not have designed them that way. Yet these imperfect eyes work better than any camera man has invented. By pure random chance, a single appearance of an eye would be highly improbable, impossible according to mathematicians.
Darwin wrote:
To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree.
The ability to fly supposedly evolved spontaneously by chance at least four times: for insects, birds, mammals (bats) and reptiles. Yet intelligent man did not figure out the principles of flight until the past century.
Transitional species. Many of what Darwin considered to be transitional species have been discredited. Even Archaeopteryx, once thought to be transitional between reptiles and birds, is not. Modern birds have been found deeper in the fossil record. For the most part nature's divisions are not blurred and indistinct, currently or in the fossil record. The phyla appear in the fossil record almost instantaneously in what is known as the Cambrian explosion, with no apparent connections.
Transitional leaps. According to evolutionists, reptiles evolved into birds. Yet the lung of a reptile is very different from the lung of a bird. How could one design evolve into the other step by tiny step, with each step being an improvement over the previous one?
Microevolution cannot be extrapolated to explain macroevolution. Microevolution (one species of bird to another closely related species) has been fairly well established. But no natural mechanism has been even been suggested to explain how macroevolution (from reptile to bird, for example) could possibly have happened.
The Anthropic Principle. The more scientists learn, the more it appears that the universe is tailor-made for life. The more accurately and extensively astronomers measure the universe, the more finely tuned they find it to be. There are a minimum of 25 characteristics of the universe which must be "just so" for life of any kind to be possible. There are more than 40 characteristics which must be "just so" for life as we know it on earth to exist. Here are some examples:
Distance from the moon to earth. If the moon were farther away, there would not be enough mixing of ocean waters by the tides. If it were closer, the tidal effects would be too great.
Atmospheric electric discharge rate. If there were more lightning, there would be too much fire destruction. If less, not enough nitrogen would be fixed in the atmosphere.
Rotational speed of the earth. If it were slower, there would be too much temperature difference between day and night. If it were faster, the wind velocities would be catastrophic.
Surface gravity. If it were greater, the atmosphere would retain too much ammonia and methane. If it were less, the atmosphere would lose too much water vapor.
Tilt of axis and distance from the sun. If it were different, the temperature variations would be too great to support a stable water cycle.
Amount of water vapor. If it were greater, there would be a runaway greenhouse effect. If less, there would not be enough rainfall.
Amount of carbon dioxide. If it were greater, there would be a runaway greenhouse effect. If less, plants would be unable to maintain efficient photosynthesis.
If these things and many others were just slightly different, life as we know it would be impossible.
C.S. Lewis wrote:
In the science, Evolution is a theory about changes; in the Myth it is a fact about improvements. To those brought up on the Myth, nothing seems more normal, more natural, more plausible, than that chaos should turn into order, death into life, ignorance into knowledge.
Science itself has proven that chaos does not naturally and normally turn into order. Life comes only from life (law of biogenesis). Things do not improve naturally as a matter of course (second law of thermodynamics). Things improve because of intelligent input. For example, the technology we enjoy in the present age is a result of human intelligence, not random chance. Science has given us a great deal, but not everything that exists can be explained scientifically.
In the words of Phillip Johnson,
What is presented to the public as scientific knowledge about evolutionary mechanisms is mostly philosophical speculation and is not even consistent with the evidence once the naturalistic spectacles are removed. If that leaves us without a known mechanism of biological creation, so be it: it is better to admit ignorance than to have confidence in an explanation that is not true.

3610,evolution,"Biological evolution is genetic change in a population, from one generation another, with continuous evolution over many generations often resulting in the development of new varieties and species. It is the mechanism in which species adapt or respond to environmental changes, and failure to do so, often leads to extinction.
Most of Darwin's arguments for evolution, in his publication of On the Origin of Species, were based almost exclusively on evidence from living organisms. Then there is the fossil record, the diversity of living organisms...the peppered moth, fruit fly, and DNA studies...to mention just a sprinkling of the areas where overwhelming evidence has been compiled, supporting the "fact" and "existence" of evolution.
This argument could easily be a debate about the meaning of "proof," "fact," and "theory." As I mentioned before, evolution is both a theory and a fact...because "theories" and "facts" are two different things...not rungs in a ladder of increasing certainty.
Theories are models, or structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts are the world's empirical data. Facts do not go away while the evolutionists and creationists debate over their respective theories to explain them.

Evolution as a Fact;
Observed changes in Fruit Fly populations in the Lab.
Flu Virus evolving from year to year.
Bacteria evolving to become immune to antibiotics.
These changes are not merely adaptation they are referred to as MICRO Evolution.
Evolution as a Theory;
All current life forms on Earth have evolved from a single species.
One Species over a long period of time and through many thousands of steps of MICRO evolution becoming a new distinct species.
This is referred to as MACRO Evolution.
So Evolution is BOTH a Theory and a Fact.
To say that Evolution and Creationism stand on the same grounds is nothing less than nonsense.
Evolution like all of the other disciplines of Science, puts forth a theory and gathers evidence to support that theory. If in doing so it finds enough evidence that proves the theory, great. We now have a proven fact.
If in the gathering of the evidence it comes across evidence that contradicts or DISproves the theory, then the theory is either modified or proven false and thrown out.
Creationism on the other hand starts with the ending and tries to gather evidence to prove that theory, ignoring or tossing out any evidence which contradicts or DISproves the preconceived conclusion. Much like shooting an arrow into a wall then later painting a bullseye around the arrow.
Many have suggested that Science and Religion can co-exist, but many recent and yet to come discoveries are proving that to be an unrealistic compromise.
To even consider putting Evolution and creationism on the same grounds would be like putting Astronomy and Astrology on the same grounds. Or giving equal weight to Chemistry and Alchemy.
Lets face it, Science and technology are accelerating the Age of Enlightenment that we entered into a few hundred years ago at a breathtaking speed. And the Religious fundamentalists are being dragged kicking and screaming into the the future that casts doubt on many of their preconceived notions and disproves beyond a shadow of a doubt some of their most basic erroneous beliefs. They see this as an attack on their faith. Thus they protest progress. And the problem for many in society is this;
Do we return to a religious Dark Ages and ignore reality and new discoveries by turning off our brains and saying "God did it? Do we let the religious superstitions of the past regain their hold and control over society and dictate what discoveries researchers may or may not proclaim? If so which researcher will be the next Galileo convicted and condemned for having the courage to make a discovery that contradicts religion?

2689,evolution,""I completely believe in evolution. However, just because it make soo much sense does not make it a fact. In order to firmly say that something exists it must be a fact."
The problem with this argument is that it's a form of radical skepticism. Sure, if every empirical sign signifies X is true, we can still say X is not true. You can always knock any empirical argument to a non-absolute truth. For instance, let's consider whether there's a thing called gravity. Is there? What proof is there?
Well, every human would say they're more or less glued to the planet. But, so what, that's just people's experiences. And, if we get to a scale small enough, gravity seems to play no role at all in the forces of small particles. Here's gravity, but it has inconsistencies. Therefore, gravity cannot be a fact.
In a sense, that's your argument. But that's not true. We can all accept that there are scientific issues with gravity; our understanding of the concept isn't perfect--whether that's for a lack of imagination, will, or intelligence is beyond me to comment. But just because we can't perfectly understand gravity it doesn't mean that gravity is not a fact. And, if it's not, then any empirical phenomena is not a fact. No system is perfect.

I have two comments here:
(1) Yes, there definitely are 'transitional fossils'. Lots of them. Wikipedia "Transitional Fossils" and you'll be greeted with hundreds (literally) of examples. You can look at the references the the foot of the article to check their validity. I guarantee you'll struggle to find any significant flaws, if any.
(2) Say that you have two fossils: A and C. Now, in this case A evolved into C, but scientists/geologists haven't found any 'transitional fossils' to illustrate the change (even though DNA and molecular biology studies prove it beyond reasonable doubt). Then they find a perfect 'transitional fossil' that we'll call B. Creationists would now just say well you can't show how A evolved into B or how B evolved into C with fossils! Do you see? By finding a 'transitional fossil', you essentially just create another two gaps that 'are in need of filling'. By this logic, all fossils are transitional!
I really find this argument frustrating; it's parroted again and again, but it's just so flawed.
"...there is no direct proof to explain common lineages."
But there is. When you examine the DNA of all the organisms, you find a perfect family tree forms. It is a pyramid of relation that you can quite literally place into a family tree that illustrates how all organisms alive today share a common ancestor. Humans and chimpanzees have a common ancestor; humans and snails have a common ancestor; humans and dandelions have a common ancestor; humans and Haemophilius influenzae have a common ancestor.

1734,evolution,"are we talking darwinian micro-evolution, darwinian macro-evolution, or atheist origins? this debate never gets anywhere because people don't know what the hell they are talking about. im not saying im an expert by any means, but i am aware there taking this as one issue with exactly two sides is a vastly over-simplistic way of looking at things, and is not very productive.
i believe in creationism. by that i mean that i believe in intelligent and further intentional design. i believe that evolution has, at present, far too many holes to truly be proposed as "the" answer, and the notion that it is strictly scientific is humorous to me. i don't know quite what i am arguing against, as i already said, so i am going to touch on one aspect of evolution and try to offend as many people as possible in one go. hopefully ill get some backlash and something will get moving.
lets start with micro-evolution:
micro evolution is observed scientific fact. as presented by darwin, it is the idea that certain traits are advantageous to survival, and that these, therefore, come to be more dominant over time. alleles thin themselves out and the only alleles that remain are those that promote particular characteristics that an organism finds useful. thus, a bird with a short beak lands on an island where the food source is easier to get to with a long beak. as the kids are born, the ones with long beaks eat better, have more sex, have more babies, and generally crowd out the shorter beaked brothers. this continues through the generations with beaks getting longer and longer. eventually, you get two species of birds that look very different. this is, however, the loss of the alleles that promote short beaks, not the fabrication of a new allele that promotes long beaks. there is an enormous difference.
darwin assumed that, if these changes were allowed to go on long enough, eventually one animal could turn into another sort of animal altogether. he called this idea "macro-evolution". modern taxonomist often regard two species as being divergent if a male of one type and a female of the second type are unable to produce fertile offspring. thus, a horse and a donkey are different species because, while they can produce offspring, this offspring (an f1 hybrid) is sterile (or is almost always sterile).
there are recorded incidents involving a diverging species. i can only think of one off the top of my head, but i do remember it involved masquitos. the problem is that there is no evidence that new genetic material was introduced. it seems, rather, that it was a loss of genetic information that caused the species to diverge. one of the examples of evolution cited (still) in textbooks is the english "peppered" moth. in this example it is shown that the light colored moths flourished until the industrial revolution blackened the trees they lived on with soot. the peppered moths, then, became dark in color.
this is an excellent example of natural selection, but is not proof of any kind of macro-evolution. both light and dark phenotypes were present at all times. no new genetic information was created. it would be as if a disease wiped out all right handed people. the human species would likely become left hand dominant (at least for a while), but this does not change us fundamentally as a species, or make us anything "more than human". it simply means that we have lost the alleles for right handedness. we have become more specialized as a species by a loss of genetic information. we have not gained genetic information.
in order, then, for the principles of micro-evolution (which is demonstratable) to apply to macro-evolution (which is not scientific by any definition) all living organisms would have to have started with some organism that contained all genetic information necessary to produce every different species on earth. there is no genetic precedent for something like that.
there is further no record, fossil or otherwise, that would in any way conclusively point to macro-evolution as a viable theory for the origins of mankind. the idea that the origins of mankind is something that can be discussed in absolute scientific terms is pretentious and absurd. the persistence of the idea that such an assertion is absolutely true, and that it quantitatively removes the possibility of metaphysical beings is without base, and should be shameful to the atheist community.",7,0,Creationism
1223,evolution,"You do realize that it's beyond futile to discuss this subject with Atlas no?",7,0,Creationism
1485,evolution,"You say evolution is a fact, but which one are you talking about? I'm assuming you are talking about Macro Evolution, but I'll talk about Micro Evolution as well.
First lets talk about micro evolution. Micro Evolution is the adaption and changes within species. Birds are examples of this. Depending on where they live, certain birds have larger and stronger beaks so they can crack the larger nuts open. Other birds have longer, but skinnier beaks so they can fit there beaks into smaller areas. They don't need the large beaks because of where they live. The seeds are smaller where they live, so therefore they don't need large beaks. Micro Evolution is a proven fact. We always see certain changes within the species.
Macro Evolution however, is the addition of new traits or the transition to a new specie. An example is a dinosaur evolving into a bird. Dinosaurs are reptiles which have nothing to do with birds. They changes into a totally different specie. This is never observed and cannot be proven.
So don't say it's a fact when they can't even observe it.",7,0,Creationism
3312,evolution,"Well, you certainly took your time showing up to this discussion, but all comments are always welcome.
Yes, change over time. That's all. Got it. But There is a domino effect that is implied and it is a bit nitpicky to seperate that from the discussion and state that those making reference to the domino effect are being ignorant somehow. Within the scientific scheme you have (predominantly) the Big Bang which is supposed to explain how a fertile sphere such as earth might come about to begin with. At that point something very unscientific happens aka life begins from non-life. At that point evolution takes over. All of this falls into one big sphere called naturalism where both material and biology do basically the same thing; improve or become more complex and functional over time. That is the reason for the mincing of words that seems to upset you, yet there is nothing in there that takes the role or modus operandi for granted or sees it ignorantly. It is a scientific theory, yes, but one that becomes more problematic with every single one of the thousands of publications you reference. Scientific FACTS continuously muddy the waters of evolution and it exists not like gravity as something we see in action but more like philosophy that can be visualized and religiously held. The genome does not increase in information, but its potential decreases over time. Species may adapt, but that adaptation is always drawn from genetic information that is already present in the DNA of said species. At no time does adaptation involve the acquisition of genetic information. Once a Species adapts thoroughly or is bred thoroughly, like a beagle, then future generations beyond that species will no longer possess the potential to exhibit traits that its great grand parents did. When you read some of Darwins assumptions about observing animal breeding you realize that he was writing in an age prior to the work of Gregor Mendel who had not published his genetic studies yet. Most of the breakthrough work regarding thermaldynamics was also not published at that time. DNA had not been discovered nor the atom nor an even rudimentary understanding into the complexity of "Simple cells". Had Darwin tried to publish 50 years later it would have been laughed at, but to many chips were on the table by that time due to the desire to shed religion at all costs and not because of compelling facts. There are no compelling facts to support evolution, only compelling arguments born of dislike of the idea of God. Many many many facts support adaptation and changes that diminish the future potential of a species, but nothing that works the way it is assumed evolution should. Unlike gravity, we cannot and have never witnessed a single incident of true evolution (in the progressive, non diminshing sense).",7,0,Creationism
3312,evolution,"THIS IS A REBUTTAL TO “JULIAN 1” WHOSE POST DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE SITE BUT WAS AUTO SENT TO MY EMAIL.
J1: Before I begin I first want to say evolution is not a belief for those who diminish the belief of god, that is absolutely not true.
ATLAS: The vast majority of the time it is, in fact, the very vehicle for all disregard, and snubbing, of anything even remotely religious. A few try to play in both playgrounds but as the most studied elements of each side of the fence will tell you it is almost an embarrassment to think that they are compatible… although very American in its desire to think the middle ground is where the truth is. This issue is a sidebar none the less and agree to disagree.
J1: Darwin himself was a very religious man, I mean, Darwin's name is in one of the most famous catholic churches in England.
ATLAS: Irrelevant. There are plenty of evolution fans who would take you to task on this. I don’t necc. Care as it does not determine the nature, truth, or value of his theories.
J1: The Roman Catholic Church officially adopted and have accepted Darwin’s idea of the theory of evolution as a scientifically accurate theory.
ATLAS: The Catholic Church is not a great source for scientific validation and it is historically known for its compliance with popular norms. i.e. The bible is more flexible to the Church than is Shakespeare or any other great work and is not really viewed as “The Word of God”… unless the word of the majority is the word of god. But again, not really relevant and agree to disagree.
J1: So evolution is 100% absolutely not for those who don't believe in god. I believe in god.
ATLAS: Understood. And agree. But while I have never met Richard Dawkins and would disagree with him vehemently about a great many things, we would both agree that individuals in this category are watering down both and have not analyzed their positions very deeply. To say one “believes in god” (lowercase “g” noted) is an easy thing to say. Most Americans who throw out that statement have approached the idea of god as if it were the shelves of Walmart or a buffet. We see the selections and put together a cart or a plate that meets with our tastes, preferences, and outlook. Occasionally we challenge ourselves with something new that we are not certain of and either keep it or discard it. The end result is a “god” who is nothing more than a mirror image of ourselves or a supernatural alter ego who basically agrees with us on everything. But because we are Americans we do not call this Narcissism or blind pride, we call it open mindedness and non-fundamentalism.
J1: Another thing, we cannot take the theory of the big bang and put in the same realm of evolution when they're not even in the same realm of the science world. Evolution is biology, the big bang is astronomy.
ATLAS: Yes, I already covered this. Turn the clock backwards and watch the process of evolution roll back in time. What happens then? We watch the process of stellar evolution work backwards to the big bang. The two work together to create a storyline from an ancient nothingness to this moment. They share many fundamentals to include that they are both in the realm of science as a whole but primarily the fundamental idea that God has never been nor will ever be necc. for any of it. (Of course we can see nothing with regard to life emerging from Non-life because it defies all known observation and experimentation.)
J1: You said that we cannot see evolution happening as we speak such as we can for gravity, well that's actually not true. It is a proven
fact that simple creatures such as (invertabrates, plants, bacteria) were one earth long before complex creatures,
ATLAS: “Proven fact”. Interesting. I notice you are very fond of the gravity thing. Drop a pen and confirm gravity. What can you see to confirm evolution? Nothing. Except of course the dreams of Charles Lyell. As a contemporary of Darwin he created the initial diagram of layers of the earth and the sorts of creatures that should be found within. This was not based upon any field findings or data but pure theory about what SHOULD BE there. The logical necessity of this diagram was quickly understood and a deviation from its basics would result in catastrophic failure for Darwin’s acceptance. Now the data comes in and the data has always, in a very general sense, ordered itself as you make reference to. The trouble is the fact that you have been taught a generalized state of affairs with the not so anomalous anomalies removed. There are places where a single tree fossil cuts through millions of years of layers. There are places where human artifacts are intermingled in the Jurassic or older. There are places where it is even upside down. These are brushed aside by academics because they have to have logical explanations and then students are given the white wash. The process by which both organic and material are settled in the course of a flood are much more in line with the data and pretty much explain all phenomenon associated with what is actually found.
Here are some actual facts which are void of philosophical innuendo. As with all actual facts and observable phenomenon, they do not conflict with the Bible.
The oldest tree is measured in thousands of years.
The oldest river delta is measured in thousands of years.
The oldest coral reef is measured in thousands of years.
Dozens of elements which increase at regular rates in the world’s oceans only clock back thousands of years.
The magnetosphere declines in strength at a constant rate. Clock it back more than 100,00 years and the earth is like living in a microwave.
The moon recedes at a constant rate. Move it back more than 250,000 years and the earth is torn apart by the gravitational effects.
There is no such thing as a vestigial anything. There are only genes and organs which we do not yet fully understand. The classification of vestigial is superimposed as a proof of evolution until some researcher discovers a breakthrough and the former vestigial becomes essential. This is one area were ignorance of something is used as a proof of evolution. This also hampers research as that which is vestigial is written off. The appendix is one such example. Preventative surgeries were performed on infants that removed this appendix on the basis that its vestigial nature was more trouble than it was worth. Low and behold it was discovered that the organ is essential for infant immunity development. Now that’s good science.
J1: it's impossible to assume that over 100 million years complex creatures magically appeared.
ATLAS: Why not. In the realm of science the emergence of life itself is basically magic. But, see above.
J1: Vestigial structures aren't accidents or coincidences,
ATLAS: Isn’t everything in the realm of evolution accident and coincidence? Or are you actually an ID fan?
J1: The bone structure of a human arm and that of a shrew are almost identical…
Atlas: Got it. Know where you’re going here. Note the similarities in Davinci’s works, or Van Gogh, or Mozart, or Einstein, or Hemingway. A common creator renders common features and fingerprints.
J1: We need to keep in mind the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The principle states that in order for NO evolution to occur, there must be no genetic mutations (which happen all the time)…
ATLAS: Which part of the equation accounts for the fact that mutations are bad and destructive? I guess according to that equation it would be n the interest of humanity to move as many people around Chernobyl in order to accelerate “God’s process” of progress. The rest of your thought on this only demonstrates the importance of ALREADY EXISTING GENES to interplay in order to broaden the canvas. But again, no new colors are being created, just mixing and expanding of already existing ones.
J1: Why do giraffes have long necks and live in environments where their food source is high up in the tress... Why do lizards have the ability to camouflage and live in environments filled with predators…
ATLAS: Your premise is that random chance and accident produces superior results than purposeful creation according to a plan by a super intellect, even though everything within the realm of life and science proves opposite. In case you missed it, the answer is; creatures made according to a specific plan would exhibit that result. Chance events, or anything left to natural processes will decay and become more inefficient.
J1: Does this mean god doesn't exist?
ATLAS: I would say it is part of the evidence FOR God.
J1: Many religions understand why evolution just makes perfect sense, and have decided that evolution is god’s way bringing new organisms to earth, changing our world.
ATLAS: Oh, Chaos and death and fruitless pain are god’s way of doing business. Praise god. Perfect sense? Despite contradicting so many scientific principles and everyday observations, really? You are correct though, in surmising that evolution is only possible by supernatural intervention, i.e. every step forward would be a miracle. The fact that many religions have thrown in the towel to have a better looking store front for the customers is unimportant. This only indicates that some religions don’t understand the facts and implications as well as they should.
J1: I took a few classes about evolution in college. There was a girl in the class who sat next to me who took the class to
try and prove to everyone that evolution was completely false, she was so enlightened by the course, her mindset went from evolution doesn't exist, to evolution is gods change over time.
ATLAS: Again, praise that wonderful god of pointless pain. And for every story you present of a convert I can give you a story of an Atheistic or agnostic PHD in various scientific disciplines who, due to the evidentiary discrediting of evolution and big bang, became born again Christians. Such a discussion is round and round and pointless.
I am fully aware of the probability analysis that keeps the imagination of evolution alive in the minds of so many. I know that a number can be found to describe the odds of one trillion six sided dice being rolled such that all six sided dice show a “one”. Given enough time anything is possible. Trouble is, no amount of rolls will give any of those six sided dice a face of “seven”. That is the sort of probability that evolution is up against when real scientific “laws” of physics, chemistry, and biology are brought to bear.",7,0,Creationism

3879,evolution,"I have read your entire argument. You do hold quite a strong argument in a lot of regions, but I see a problem at the beginning. You define a theory as, and I quote, "an explanation of concept/idea that is supported by evidence and/or many experiments/trials and is widely accepted by the scientific community."
A fair enough definition, and one I will not dispute. The problem lies with your application of your definition. You are right to apply it to the matter of intelligent design, but grow lax when it comes to the matter of evolution. By your own admission, evolution is an idea based on observation. However, there is no evidence to support your claim. For the sake of my own definitions, I do not mean microevolution, in which a species favors one genetic trait over another. Rather, I refer to macroevolution, in which a leap is made from one species to another. There is no method to experiment or test the concept, either.
As a result, by following the remainder of your reasoning, evolution suffers the same judgment as intelligent design. Both should end up in a religious studies classroom.
Either the definition of theory must somehow distinguish the two ideas, or both are committed to the same classroom. In the latter case, one cannot fairly denote one evolution to one field of study and intelligent design to another.

These same facts could be wielded by one who believes in intelligent design, but in either case, these facts are not conclusive evidence.

With this in mind, you have yet to prove more than survival of the fittest and microevolution. Your example, for the sake of argument, has proven that tail length is helpful for survival of a species, and as such, that trait is favored. You have yet to show that it changed species. The only difference is that a genetic trait has become popular.

Do I understand you correctly? Carbon dating is inaccurate for recent dates that have been observed and can be verified without the application of science, but is highly accurate at dates we have precious little verifying means? Pardon me, but if a system does not work when one can easily verify it, I find it difficult to believe that it works when verification is less present.
Microevolution and macroevolution are hardly the same thing, hence the opposing prefixes. By googling, “observed instances of speciation”, the article does little more than a fly version of Mendel’s pea plants, thereby establishing dominant and recessive genetic traits. What does that have to do with your point? The same question applies to your comment about Larus gulls.
And back to the matter of skulls. What are the skulls that you speak of, and how do they validate evolution? Are there skulls that demonstrate a species in the midst of evolution and not simply an extinct species? Is it intact? I raise that latter question because I notice often the skulls I observe are formed from a jawbone and a few more fragmented pieces, with guesswork and theories filling in the empty spaces. Could you at least cite, possibly explain, something more specific before you decide my intelligence is faulty?
Lastly, you have provided more than enough to read, but very little to support yourself.

The "no time before the big bang" position is not philosophical. It is a matter of mathematics. The big bang is in essence a mathematical theory which is well-supported by the evidence. One of its consequences is that time, as we understand it, loses its meaning prior to the big bang.
The analogy is inaccurate, but if it makes you feel comfortable imagine that time is infinte, but compressed to such a degree during the big bang that it has a measurable beginning, *measured at the rate that we currently experience it*.
So the question, "what happened before the big bang?" is meaningless on more than one level. (a) we have no way of knowing, (b) the mathematics says that time itself didn't exist before the big bang, and (c) it's not clear that the question actually makes sense in the first place.
There is no "poof" in the big bang.
Roger Penrose's lecture on this is enlightening; it's on youtube, search for "roger penrose big bang".
If anybody came up with a viable creation hypothesis, i.e. an argument that is falsifiable, supported by all the evidence we have and predictive so that future observations can look for something we wouldn't otherwise expect, then scientists might take it seriously. That is the standard of rigor for scientific hypotheses; imagine then how powerful a theory is to a scientist. Scientific theories are as close as we get to the truth.

4092,evolution,"I find that many creationists overlook the fact that there is an infinite number of possibilites to the creation of the universe, and not just two. They feel that there is EITHER the scientific explanation, or else there is God.
In fact the strongest basis for my own atheism is that there are many differing religions on Earth, and the only thing that the vast majority share is a divine creator. So the argument should always be about whether the universe was created by a conscious being or a natural event. Unfortunately I always see too many references to God in debates such as this.
The Bible was originally penned by human beings and was once considered a blasphemous text. People mocked Christianity in the same way we today mock Scientology. Personally I see no difference between the two in this respect, only that one has enjoyed the benefit of thousands of years and an increasingly powerful hub (the Catholic Church) to spread its message.
So even if I were to be convinced away from my strong atheistic beliefs and accept the universe was created by a divine being, and not a natural event, I would still be very far away indeed from accepting Christianity as the true faith.
For that reason, let us avoid specifically referencing "God" in this debate as it is an entirely separate issue from the one which we are discussing.",7,0,Naturalism
337,evolution,"And thank you, sir, I too enjoy debating points that actually merit discussion :-)
Before I begin, let me put my position in context. Suppose that something did exist that was "outside" the universe. Then either that entity interacts with the universe - in which case its presence could in theory be detected by some means - or else it does not, in which case it can have no impact on our lives within this universe. I'm happy with either position. Since we have been unable to detect any external interference in the universe, I tend to align myself with the "it doesn't interact" position.
This is compatible with the view that God set the universe in motion, and then sat back to watch. It is also compatible - although far less likely to be so for reasons I will come to - with the idea that when we die, we arrive in front of the creator for judgement. I'm happy with that too. If God is good, then I believe he will accept my lifelong position of sticking to what I know and what can be deduced about the universe, and being skeptical about the rest. If he doesn't accept this, then in my view he is not a being worth worshiping in the first place.
Judgement I consider unlikely, because it seems clear that what we are is solely a function of the matter that makes us up. The evidence for this comes from brain trauma victims - my cousin Grant is one of those unfortunates, and to a lesser extent so is my uncle Giles, who had a brain tumor. A slight alteration in the matter of our brains can lead to a drastic change in our personalities. It is difficult to reconcile this data with the idea of an eternal soul that somehow preserves our essence.
"What lit the wick that was the creation of the universe?"
It's not necessarily the case that anything lit the wick. As I explained in my video on time and the big bang, from a theoretical outside observer's point of view, which I referred to as a "superclock" (such a thing of course being impossible), the universe is in fact infinite in extent. It only has a measurable age because of the expansion of time from a singularity at the origin.
So yes, I guess you're right to say that this has philosophical consequences that can be discussed, but one must first be sure that one's position is consistent with what the mathematics say, because the big bang theory is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. What are the philosophical consequences? As I see it, they are that discussion of things that are before or outside the big bang is meaningless, because it is in principle untestable.
I do not wish to suggest that I would not dearly like to know the answers to such questions; I would, just as I would dearly love to escape the confines of Einstein's relativity and travel to the edge of the universe. What I am suggesting is that such knowledge is apparently impossible, not to say meaningless in the sense that the question "what is the colour of a circle?" is meaningless. That should not and will not stop me and other scientist from doing our best to poke holes in our current understanding. Not only is that part of the scientific process, but we also have good motivation to do so, because much of what science currently has to say about the universe is, quite honestly, downright depressing. But the facts, hard though they are, must be accepted.

337,evolution,"PS - technical addendum to what I said before.
There is a school of thought that says that our universe is the result of the explosion of a black hole in another universe. We would not initially be causally connected with the other universe, but over time the light-cones would intersect. This has the striking implication that the rate of expansion might increase after a time, as the universes become causally connected and matter outside our universe starts to pull our space-time apart. And indeed there is some evidence that the rate of expansion is increasing.
However, this idea presents several other sticky problems. For one thing, we don't know whether it is possible for a black hole to explode, although the big bang itself seems to suggest that this can happen (it was a singularity just like any other black hole, after all). It may be that after a time we will observe daughter-universes expanding within our own universe. The jury is out on this one. But it's an extremely interesting idea, although also terrifying in the sense that if it is correct, then we are even more insignificant than we previously thought. It is difficult to imagine, given the size of the universe, that we are any more than a fleeting concern to a supposed creator.",7,0,Naturalism
337,evolution,"Oh boy. Another one. Look up the Larus gull, or JFGI: observed instances of speciation. And don't be idiotic and insist that there should be a crocoduck. Look at the Wikipedia article on Hominidae. Our species diverged from the chimps (Pan genus) around 5 million years ago. More recently the ancestral line forked into H. sapiens and H. neandertalensis. Our line survived; theirs did not. Do some reading, and then come back. www.talkorigins.org is a good place to start.
As for the origin of the universe: If this alleged creator doesn't have to have a beginning/creator, then why should the universe? The universe is far simpler than the creator would have to be. Besides which, we know from the big bang theory that the early universe would necessarily have been causally isolated from anything that was allegedly "outside" it. It is also, from a certain point of view, infinite in time. Time as we experience it was a product of the big bang just as space was.",7,0,Naturalism

1. It's called taxonomy. Clade divisions are based on a multitude of evidence, from fossils to molecular biology, geography and anatomy. And we know how old they are by, again, a multitude of methods: carbon dating, vulcanism, chemical analysis, geological analysis, and so on.
2. If God is "outside time" (whatever that means), then does this not imply that he is causally isolated from our universe? In which case, is it not true to say that he is and will always be irrelevant to our existence?
3. "...the universe has not reached equilibrium yet..." Wow. Big word, what do you think it means? This is just a plain nonsense, what sort of equilibrium is it that you think the universe hasn't reached?
4. The big bang was not a ball of dirt. That's just beyond ridiculous. Perhaps try reading Wikipedia first next time?
Last I heard, it was the Bible told us we came from dirt...
5. Ditto, and how do you expect the "ball of dirt" to spin faster and faster? Where does the energy come from?
6. You're waving your hand vaguely at what is called conservation of angular momentum. The universe has no angular momentum, there being no frame of reference against which to define a moment. As for why Venus rotates "the wrong way" - how about looking it up? Turns out Venus is actually upside-down, most likely due to an earlier impact with a large interplanetary body.
7. No they don't. The theory in no way implies this.
8. Perhaps try coming up with your own, original arguments rather than copying drivel that was swept away a century ago?",7,0,Naturalism
337,evolution,"1a) There are thousands of intermediate forms. There's a bloody list on www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-intermediate.html.
1b) You obviously have no understanding of evolution. Humans and chimps have a common ancestor. One did not evolve from the other. Even a basic study of the biology will demonstrate how utterly wrong your idea of evolution is.
1c) See Ken Miller talking about the bacterial flagellum on Youtube. This was one of the most important reasons why ID was adjudged unscientific in Kitzmiller v. Dover. Miller demolished the "irreducible complexity" argument. And you get to watch him doing it.
1d) Same old "carbon dating doesn't work" trope. Get with the century. It works extremely well within certain parameters. Outside of those parameters, you get garbage. That's why we cross-check with other methods. The ages of the fossils are known to a scientific certainty.
2. I'm a mathematician, and I CAN prove that anything that was "outside" the big bang cannot be causally connected with it. In English, that means either God is inside the universe and therefore subject to its timescale, or else he cannot interact with it. Proof trumps opinion.
3. What you're trying to suggest is that the universe should become isotropic over a long time-scale. There are at least three problems with your argument: (a) gravity doesn't permit this to happen; (b) on an interior timescale, the universe is not infinitely old, it's 13.7bn years old - the infinite age is what you get if you're on the outside looking in; (c) there's no known physics that indicates that the universe should converge to isotropy. Science fail.
4. I suggest you change schools. The big bang was not a "gathering of matter" - to the best of our knowledge, it STARTED in a singular state. The best approximation to this is a black hole. It then EXPANDED outwards, cooling and condensing as it did so. In case you're interested, the early matter of the universe was mostly hydrogen, apparently with a bit of helium mixed in. Pretty far from dirt.
5. Since the universe has no angular momentum, that's not a question I have to answer. It did not "spin faster and faster", because it did not spin. The energy problem only arises in your peculiar interpretation.
6. Have you actually done any reading at all on this subject? Because if you had, you would know that Venus completely rebuilds its surface every few hundred thousand years or so. Hence it's one of the least-cratered planets in the solar system. An asteriod of sufficient mass to change its axis of rotation wouldn't have to be planet-killingly large. Particularly since it would have to strike the planet at an angle. As for why it's round - it's round for the same reason all the other planets are round. That's the lowest-energy configuration of the matter. The relatively slow rate of rotation also supports the impact theory, because angular momentum would have bled off as the gyroscopic effect reasserted its axis of rotation.
7. The arguments you "came up with" are well-known tropes of the creationist movement, all of which have been dismissed decades ago. So I hardly have to work to provide the rebuttals.",7,0,Naturalism
337,evolution,"And your faith blinds you.
1. Ken Miller - what he demonstrated is that each piece of the flagellum by itself is adaptive. What makes you think the bacterium would die if it didn't have it? It would simply be less efficient at reproducing. The same applies to the eye - 5% of an eye is a hell of a lot better than no eye at all. There wouldn't be a flagellum until all the parts started to cooperate, true, but there is still advantage in having the separate parts by themselves. That's what Miller was saying.
2. Don't try to lecture me on carbon dating. I know how radioactive decay works. Radioactive carbon is not formed naturally on the earth's surface. It requires high-energy radiation which is only available in the upper atmosphere. Therefore once it is embedded in rock, the amount of carbon 14 is fixed, and since it decays at a known rate, we can measure the difference between the number of radioactive isotopes and the number of non-radioactive isotopes to find out what the original composition was and how long it's been decaying. Carbon dating works. See http://www.acad.carleton.edu/curricular/BIOL/classes/bio302/Pages/CarbonDatingBack.htm. Besides which, we always cross-check with other dating methods.
3. Nobody knows how the singularity that was the initial universe got there. Don't pretend that you do, and I won't pretend that I do. We know it was there, and that's all. Postulating a god does not provide any additional information, and is not a testable hypothesis. It's not an explanation at all, and in fact it raises more questions than it answers.
4. Nobody is in charge of the universe. And that 2% estimate of yours is way off, several orders of magnitude larger than most scientists would put it. If there was a 2% probability of life arising, then the galaxy would be a crowded place, because there are billions of planets available to nurture life.
5. "We can't know because nobody was there". Don't be silly. If that were true, then I could turn it around and say you can't know the universe was created because nobody was there. We know Venus rebuilds its surface because there is evidence to support that hypothesis. Apart from the lack of craters, there is evidence of periodic extreme vulcanism which would remelt the surface, wiping out any impact craters. Venus is geologically active, despite not having a plate tectonic system that we can discern. This is an interesting subject, and there's a lot of literature out there. Read it.
6. That's a cheek. You haven't given a single hypothesis that is testable. I, on the other hand, have studied this material. So when I ask "how do they know?" it's a question I can answer. How do you know God exists? What's your evidence?

Teachers have to spend even LOOOOOOOOOOOOONGEEEER to teach children evolution and abiogenesis and try filling in the major gaps which are left. What student can easily comprehend that the first amoeba turned, through a preposterous chain of events, into a human? The only students I know who comprehend that are ones who do so merely for the passing mark. Rest of the time they scoff at it and don't think about how the human race came into being.
You are correct that teaching the creation theory of each religion would take a long time, but the Christian Creation Theory has its own text as the explanatory guidelines as well as more science to back it up than any proof evolution can muster. In fact, scientists are so confused as to exactly how 'evolution', abiogenesis etcetera works (because it doesn't and has gaps), that the theories are perpetually changing. For example, suppose that we did get a dog or cat out of the 'former species'. How exactly did each dog or cat develop into its own species instead of moving on to that of another creature? Why don't we just have one species of each?
Evolution has such an incredible explanation that when opne really tries to comprehend, one gets lost. the Scientific mumbo jumbo sounds flawless, but it really isn't.
The complexity of living systems could never evolve by chance—they had to be designed and created. A system that is irreducibly complex has precise components working together to perform the basic function of the system. (A mousetrap is a simple example.) If any part of that system were missing, the system would cease to function. Gradual additions could not account for the origin of such a system. It would have to come together fully formed and integrated. Many living systems exhibit this (vision, blood-clotting, etc.). When you look at a watch, you assume there was a watchmaker. A watch is too complex to "happen" by chance. Yet such living systems are almost infinitely more complex than a watch. They could not be random—they simply had to be designed and created.
"The high information content of DNA could only have come from intelligence. Information science teaches that in all known cases, complex information requires an intelligent message sender. This is at the core of the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). DNA is by far the most compact information storage/retrieval system known. A pinhead of DNA has a billion times more information capacity than a 4-gigabit hard drive. Ironically, evolutionists scan the heavens using massive radio telescopes hoping for relatively simple signal patterns that might have originated in outer space, all the while ignoring the incredibly complex evidence of superior intelligence built into every human's DNA. While we're waiting to hear signs of intelligence behind interstellar communication, we're ignoring those built into us.
No mutation that increases genetic information has ever been discovered. Mutations which increase genetic information would be the raw material necessary for evolution. To get from "amoeba" to "man" would require a massive net increase in information. There are many examples of supposed evolution given by proponents. Variation within a species (finch beak, for example), bacteria which acquire antibiotic resistance, people born with an extra chromosome, etc. However, none of the examples demonstrate the development of new information. Instead, they demonstrate either preprogrammed variation, multiple copies of existing information, or even loss of information (natural selection and adaptation involve loss of information). The total lack of any such evidence refutes evolutionary theory."

Yes, but supposing that the cat evolved from the dog again, okay? You're saying that they cross breeded naturally and we got a completely different species. Yet that other species of cat and the other species of dog is left unaccounted for. So we have wolf, fox, hyena, jackal, all part of the Canidae family and not sharing any DNA with any type of cat (or other animal). The Liger and mule are of the same type of family. Again, how'd a hyena come from a combination wolf/fox, and then how'd the wolf or fox come from the bear (as an example)? How'd they reproduce and multiply from the one specific type of creature (how'd a lion have another purebred if it was the result of crossbreeding)? It's all jumbled up, mate.

OBVIOUSLY you either did not read my post all the way through, or you did a really bad job with the interpretation. No where did I say cram any religion down their throat. In fact, I said give them the info, along with explanation and allow them to decide.
In todays world, some adults treat our kids as if they were clueless or do not have a brain. Reality is kids are still able and are quite capable of becoming brainiacs. The reason they are not, is because
1. we treat them as illiterates.
2.We do not allow them to make choices, with guidance.
3. They have become lazy. Why think, either it is not important, or it is done for them.
4.We give them no credit, do not have confidence in them
5.Allow them to be turned off and lazy.
As for your first paragraph. I believe when I attended school we were taught gravity, but we also were taught that other cultures, (I distinctly remember) reading that people believed the earth to be flat. This was taught appropriately for the age I was at the time. I did not erroneousley pick the flat earth theory, because the teachers gave us all the evidence for both and then guided us to use common sense.
"Do you really expect a child educated in the way you suggest to think that knowledge is possible?"
I think it is possible for a child to be educated the way I suggested/ NOW if only the Unions and the Schools would come together and allow teachers to actually teach once again, instead of being paid babysitters, for the children we as parents and society have turned into spoiled brats....Enough said, I think you get the message!
Yes, I believe if they are taught starting when they are young up until graduation, in a way that is appropriate for their age, they can learn anything.
"Even adults are not always capable of making an informed decision, given the evidence. This is apparent from these forums. Do you really expect children to come to the right conclusions? Or are you cynically hoping that they'll pick the "easy" explanation (yours), and never give it another thought?"
I did not say the easy explanation is mine. I stated that they be taught both. For the record, I am a Christian, but it did not play a part in my statement, My belief is no matter what the subject, if they are taught appropriately content for their age, they will come to the correct conclusion.
I would not force anything down any one's throat and I believe I stated that!

My point is stated in the other rebuttal I made. It does not matter what the information is, or what it is about, what matters is if the information is presented appropriately to the student, and an explanation is given, the kids are quite capable of rendering good judgment and chosing the correct solution.
This is how all teachers should be allowed to teach.
Unfortunately we as parents are more interested in the sports and social life of our kids, rather than supplying them with knowledge to survive in this world. They need to be allowed to learn about critical thinking and using common sense to chose the right things in life based on the evidence and explanations they have been given.

And as much evolution as possible that can be crammed into a single science study. Is it really that necessary to keep Creation away so that evolution's flaws aren't exposed?
On the contrary, Creation explains a whole lot more than evolution. It even explains how life on earth began, which is beyond evolution's scientific reaches. instead, you have to have three theories - Big bang, abiogenesis (which is highly erronous) and then evolution. Whereas, in one lump sum, the Codex explains that God created the heavens and earth, darkness and light, water, trees, the Sun, moon, stars, animals, people etc. And it is backed up by the same 'evidence' that supports evolution, just interpreted very much differently.

That is negligence at best.",7,0,"against evolution lessons in schools"
2808,evolution,"I know that. It is just a matter of speech. this argument is not about the earth's spheroid qualities.
here's some of those fallacies you asked for,
"5 - Argumentum ad Populum. This is an argument addressed "to the people." This occurs when popular feelings are pandered to, when people are told what they want to hear—and what they are told is declared to be a "scientific fact."
(1) "Science is progressive and is itself evolutionary"
(2) "Evolution is the belief of moderns. "
(3) "Everyone that is educated believes this theory."
An implication of much of the evolutionary teaching is that our race has raised itself by its own bootstraps and we will eventually be gods, knowing and doing every possible thing, including inter-galactic space travel. All this appeals to the public, and they are assured that evolution must be true. At least, they surely hope so.
6 - Fallacy of Dating. Perhaps we could entitle this one the argumentum ad chronicum. The argument from age (dating fallacy) occurs when something is declared to be so simply by giving it an old date!
All through the pages of this set of books we have repeatedly observed examples of the fallacy of proving evolution simply by dating various substances as very ancient.
(1) Radioactive and other dating techniques are used to provide notoriously inaccurate dates, which are then declared to be correct. (Chapter 7.) These dates are then offered as evidence that evolutionary theory must be true. Yet, not only are the dates inaccurate, but the ancientness of such dates can never provide evidence of biological evolution; only trans-species fossil evidence from the past, and natural selection and mutational evidence today, can provide that—and both have signally failed to do so. (Chapters 13, 14, and 17.)
(2) Without any reason for doing so, fossils and sedimentary strata have been arbitrarily assigned special ancient dates in the hope that this will heighten the impression that there is something "scientific" about evolutionary claims. Yet those fallacious dates provide us with no evidence of biological evolution. (Chapter 17.)
(3) Very ancient dates have been arbitrarily assigned to paleomagnetic findings, on the basis of the erroneous dates claimed for fossils and strata. But, here again, the resultant dates are not evidence for biological evolution (Chapter 26.)
7 - Misuse of Analogy. One occurrence is referred to, and then, by analogy, is made an explanation for a different event, in order to provide evidence for a belief.
*Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), an English philosopher, frequently spoke of the struggle between animals, and then said that, therefore, human beings must continually fight together also. That is a fallacy of analogical proof. (Chapter 33.)
8 - Fallacy of Special Pleading. This fallacy occurs when an individual positively or negatively dramatizes evidence in order to make it look very good or very bad.
One example of this was *Haekel's dramatic lectures, complete with skeletons on the platform and large copies of his fraudulently prepared embryo charts. Another would be the dramatically presented "5-bone limb" charts in public presentations, to indicate evolutionary relationships. Yet, although many diverse creatures have the same number of bones in their arms, forearms, and hands, structural similarity does not demand genetic relationship. In contrast, the DNA barrier forbids one animal from descending from another. (Chapter 21.) We should stay with science, not artful words.
9 - Reasoning in a Circle. Circulus in probando, literally, "a circle in a proof," is the fallacy of circular reasoning. The cause is stated as being the proof of the effect, which normally would be all right,—but in this case, the cause IS the effect! Or A is used to prove B, then B is used to prove A!
Circular reasoning is used several times as a proof of evolutionary theory.
(1) "Because nothing was there, therefore that which exploded was nothing. Because stars were there afterward, they came from that explosion of nothing." (Chapter 1.)
(2) "It took long ages to produce evolution, and we know it occurred because there were long ages while it occurred." (Chapters 7, 9.)
(3) "There was only sand, seawater, lightning, and volcanoes to produce evolution, so we know that is what produced it. "Chapter 9.)
(4) "Only a simple organism could have arisen when life first began; there are simple organisms alive today, so this shows that life began with a simple organism." (Chapters 9, 11.)
(5) "Only the fittest have survived, so the things which have survived are the fittest." (Chapter 13.)
10 - Fallacy of Asserting the Consequences. Because an effect occurred, a certain cause must have taken place. The problem with this thinking is that several different causes could have produced that particular effect: "If It rains, I will get wet. I have gotten wet. Therefore it has rained."
(1) "We know the stars must have evolved out of nothing because they are here now, and they had to come from somewhere." (Chapter 2.)
(2) "The earth must be millions of years old, because evolution requires millions of years." (Chapter 17.)
(3) "The earth must be millions of years old, because scientists, using a score of assumptions, have radiodated it that age." (Chapter 7.)
(4) "Life had to evolve out of non-living materials, for there is no other way plants and animals could have gotten here." (Chapter 9.)
(5) "Mutations were the cause of biological evolution because there is no other means by which it could have been accomplished." (Chapter 14.)
(6) "Everything evolves—stars, earth, plants, animals, and Society—because that is the way it has to be." (Chapter 33.)
11-Argumentum ad Ignorantiam. This is the default fallacy. It is also called the "argument addressed to ignorance." Since one position cannot be proven, it must be the other; since no other position has been proven, ours must be the right one.
(1) "Since creationism could not possibly be true, ours wins by default." (Chapters 37, 29.)
(2) "Since no events in the far distant past can be scientifically falsified, then evolution must clearly be the cause of everything." (Chapter 37.)
(3) "Evolution is the only theory which scientists believe to be correct, therefore it must be the right one." (Chapter 30.)
(4) "A supernatural solution to the problem of origins is impossible—by definition!" (Chapters 29, 30.)"

For a fact to be considered 'scientific', by definition, it must be testable by experimentation and show a consistent result when tested. Evolution IS testable by experimentation, if you define genetic modeling and studies of the fossil record to be a form of experiment, but it does not fit the other part of the bill: consistent results. Some ancient creatures, such as crocodilians and the coelocanth, have survived and coexist with their 'descendants', while others, such as human 'ancestors', were phased out like outdated software after the release of the next version. Some lifeforms took 'billions of years' to randomly mutate from the primordial soup, (On a timetable that, by the way, would have taken longer by random chance than the Earth's existense.) while others appeared fully developed in a relative instant. (See the so-called 'Cambrian Explosion') Some creatures successfully evolve on the basis of 'survival of the fittest', while others (such as the bat) randomly developed multiple traits that, while useless and even detrimental on their own, are highly useful together.

It is possible that even Einsteins theory of gravitration could need further refining. So while there is plenty of evidence supporting these theories, they are not known to be facts. In fact, the only scientific field that I can think of that deals with indesputible facts is mathematics. The rest is all just theory. When you say Gravity is a fact, you're only talking about an abstract idea that were pulled towards the earth. We can at least witness gravity, and so we can make a logical deduction that it is true everywhere else in the universe, even in spite of this, it is still a theory. Nobody has witnessed evolution.

1. There is little or no evidence of erosion between the layers in rock, supposedly laid down millions of years apart. With the amount of erosion we see today, that (at least should) strike you as a little strange.
2. Every year, about 450 million tons of sodium is deposited into the ocean. Less than 28% of that makes it back out. The rest simply accumulates. Of course, my questions about radioactive decay apply here too. But even if there was none to begin with, and the input rates were as much lower as they could rationally be, and output rates as much higher, the maximum time it would take for the amount of sodium now to accumulate would be 62 million years - far longer than the 6000 we estimate, but that's not really a problem, as the beginning amount could have been far higher than nothing.

'We don't know how life first came about, but with further experiments, we'll find out.' for instance.). Anyway, all we know is that He did. Who are we to presume to know God's reasoning?
All of my evidence about God comes from the Bible, where He has revealed Himself. I believe God is a Spirit because He says so in the Bible. I believe that God always existed because it says so in the Bible (I am from everlasting to everlasting). And neither have I seen a book, well-written, remarkably consistent despite being written over a thousand year period more or less by different people, with specific, fulfilled prophecies, that has been written, or inspired by a dragon/fairy/unicorn/flying teapot. That's also my answer to the baseball. I believe God exists because there is a Book written about and by Him that DOES have evidence and logic to support it.
As for the evidence and logic - one, see the debate about the origin of morality. Although you still probably won't agree with the logic there presented. two In Daniel, sometime before 585 BC, there is a prophecy, VERY specific, about the conquest of Babylon by the Medes and Persians, followed by Alexander the Great's invasion, the splitting of the kingdom into four, and the cruel oppression of the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanus. There is also in Daniel a more obscure (though still clear in hindsight) vision of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, and then the splitting of the Roman Empire into East and West. In the New Testament Jesus predicts the downfall of Jerusalem by the Romans. And there are many other examples.
There is archeological evidence: the Dead Sea Scrolls, references to Jesus in secular writings, the 'nonexistent' Hittite empire, long a source of ridicule against the Bible, but later found, small tidbits doubted, but later confirmed by archeology, (can't remember the name of the person, but will look it up), and other things.
There is geological evidence of the Flood (no matter how much you may deny it) such as sheet erosion, rivers running THROUGH mountains (how DOES evolution explain that one? It's sure that the rivers weren't running over the tops of mountains for millions of years until finally they carved a ravine!), and more. This is just off the top of my head so there aren't heaps of examples just now.
There is anthropological (is that how you spell it?) evidence - you find a GLOBAL flood story, with many characteristics in virtually all cultures in the world. Generally if every culture has a version of the same story, then it means there must be at least some truth in the story.

While all those sites say that the Big Bang was not an explosion, I recommend the last one as it goes through and explains exactly *why* The Big Bang was not an explosion.
Here is a snippet from the first link because I doubt you are going to go to any of those; it appears you think you have done "your homework".
"Big Bang Theory - Common Misconceptions
There are many misconceptions surrounding the Big Bang theory. For example, we tend to imagine a giant explosion. Experts however say that there was no explosion; there was (and continues to be) an expansion. Rather than imagining a balloon popping and releasing its contents, imagine a balloon expanding: an infinitesimally small balloon expanding to the size of our current universe".
"You can't have an effect without a cause". I'm sorry if I did not explain myself clearly enough, I thought I did a rather good job but apparently not as you seem to have missed the point. I was in no way saying that there was a cause without an effect, I do not know how you came to that conclusion.
Let me try again.
Let's say there's this animal that looks almost like a chicken (for the point of this question it doesn't matter where this animal came from) and it lays an egg. Inside the egg, the embryo mutates. When the thing hatches out of the egg it is different to it's mother, it mutated in to a chicken. Therefore the egg came first, because while a chicken didn't lay the egg, there was essentially a chicken inside it. (evolution would not be exact, like that, as it is so slow that every generation seems the same as the last- but hopefully this time you see the point). I'm not saying this is exactly what happened, just that it's worth a thought. The restatement was because I don't think you thought about it.

1190,evolution,"You're right, the comparison between us and bananas and clouds and watermelons were not really good ones. I wasn't really thinking about them when I wrote them down. So I'm sorry. But what I really actually wanted to point out is that it's not the similarities in DNA that matter, it's the differences. A chimp has the same respiratory, circulatory, reproductive, etc, etc systems as us, at least in most areas. Their build is much the same as ours. Why would a Creator make different DNA for something that has the same function? But they also have major differences, such as their hands and feet, their faces, and especially their brain and the way it functions as compared to us. So in that way they are different. That's where the 2% of different DNA comes from. Similar DNA simply means that that DNA is coding for the same thing. It says nothing about the reason for it. It could just as easily be a common Creator as a common ancestor.
I realize, of course that the supposed common ancestor between a human and a chimpanzee did not necessarily look like either. I'm not really sure where you're going with that, though. Nor with your comment as to that a creator would make us all the same genetic distance. Well, since more of the way I'm put together and function is similar to a chimpanzee than to a whale, I would not expect to be equally genetically distant from both. That doesn't make sense.",7,0,Creation
1190,evolution,"In your Douglas Adams argument, well, I don't see anywhere in the Bible that God requires faith to exist. God exists whether we believe in Him or not. Plus, it contradicts itself - it says that one thing proves that God exists, and this proof in turn proves that He doesn't...ummm, then what about the proof that He does exist? You can't have both. Furthermore, what were you exactly meaning with the Babel fish? Not sure if you're talking about Jonah, or what.... I'm not trying to ridicule you here, I just would like to be clear on what you meant.
Next, I can't recall myself saying that I believe the Bible because God wrote it, and I believe in God because the Bible says He exists. That is indeed circular reasoning, and if I have given you that impression I apologize. I believe in God partly because of the Bible, and partly because of the experience of people. I believe in the Bible because I can see that all the verifiable things written in the Bible have been verified. History in the Bible has been vindicated time and again. There are scientific references in the Bible found out only far later by people (a good indication that it was indeed written by God). Because of these supports, the Bible becomes far more credible in the things that cannot be verified. I believe that God wrote the Bible because the Bible says so. I believe that God created the world in six days because the Bible says so. I believe that there was a year long (actually, the water was only there for 150 days) global Flood because the Bible says so. Scientific facts only corroborate my view.
As for the Flood - Noah was told to take 2 of every unclean kind and 7 of every clean kind. It's not very clear whether this is 2 and 7 pairs or individuals, but it doesn't really matter. Keep in mind that doesn't mean 2 of every modern species - it's far, far less. Such as two dogs out of all the kinds of dogs, two cats out of all the cats, etc, etc. The big animals were no doubt not so big then, being young, which would be an advantage both during the Flood, and afterwards, with reproduction. Where did the water come from/go? 'The windows of heaven were opened, and the fountain of the great deep' - it's obvious God intervened miraculously here, whether to take water from above the 'firmament' (as it says in the Creation story, that He separated the waters), or from inside the earth, or whether He simply created it. Three quarters of the earth is water today, and there is plenty of water to cover the mountains if the ocean basins were raised and the mountains flattened. There was undoubtedly massive seismic movement during the Flood, causing, for one, the continent to split apart (there's the answer of where the animals came from. After all, you also believe that all the land was in one place to start with), as well as the raising of the mountains, and the lowering of the ocean bases. The ark was indeed one of the largest wooden ships ever built, but that doesn't mean it couldn't work. After all, we still have no idea how the ancient Egyptians built the Pyramids, but that doesn't mean they didn't do it, because they obviously did.
The fossil record is something else. We don't know exactly, of course, how it happened, but wouldn't you expect the more intelligent animals to realize something was wrong and try to flee to high ground, thus being killed and buried later? And the humans would have survived longer even than that, by clinging to rafts or trees, and so mostly decomposed without ever being buried. The layers were all made basically at the same time. Besides, how do you explain marine fossils on mountain tops?",7,0,Creation

The lists in Nehemiah and Ezra are indeed hard to answer, but there are reasonable solutions. One is that there is a scribal error - which explanation I find weak, especially as it then indicates that the Bible in English is actually not inerrant. The other solution goes like this. Ezra states that THESE ARE the .... He has the right numbers. Nehemiah states that he FOUND a register of the census and used that. This census was not inspired by God, and thus could very well be inaccurate. The Bible often records things in the Bible that are part of the story, but not necessarily correct, such as the letter Sanballat wrote to Nehemiah, and others. You didn't mention this, either, but it's related, that the total number in both Nehemiah and Ezra as stated are the same, but in counting up the numbers, they don't match. However, the numbers of the clans were only the numbers of the men, as is also stated. The total number of the CONGREGATION can be interpreted as including the wives and/or children of the men, unlikely, as it would give a very skewed percentage of unmarried men, or as including the the male children who would grow up to become leaders. This seems likely.
We of course do not actually know why there is a discrepancy. My point here is not to force my opinion on you, but to show you that there are reasonable explanations, so it need not necessarily be a contradiction.
The 'contradiction' about the earth lasting forever - once again, look at the context. In Ecclesiastes, Solomon is not really speaking literally. He speaks of the sun hastening down, of the wind turning about and going in it's circuit. We too speak of the sun going down, but we don't really mean it. It's just a way of expressing ourselves. The point of Ecclesiastes is that 'everything is vanity', basically. At least it's certainly a recurring theme. Solomon is here saying that in the face of the length of time the earth has existed, what is man? What is one generation? I do not believe that his intent was to state that the earth would be literally lasting forever.
There are answers for the others, but it's late and I'm tired, so I will leave it for now.
What Jesus is saying in John 3 is not that there have never been people who have gone to heaven without dying, but rather, it is in the context of his disciples believing what He says about heaven.

*If you take this line of thought it is quite obvious that you are just assuming that everything that exists must have been created, you take it as a given.* - It is a given. Give me an example of something that has not creator. HA got you.
*ask yourself the question; "does everything that exist require a creator?” If you answer yes then you accept the premise that there are an infinite amount of things before God because if God exists then he he must have been created and therefore have a creator, and so on forever.*
- Except that God Is timeless and eternal therefore he needs no beginning and no creation. This is obvious because he cannot die and because the bible says so. The Universe is full of death so nothing in it could have created the universe and since there is death it is not eternal.
*If you answer no not everything that exists needs a creator then you must accept the implication that:
1. God does not need a creator. 2. The universe does not need a creator.*

4732,evolution,"I disagree with most of what you have to say. It may be a fallacy to derive a prescriptive statement from a descriptive statement. The only way that a person could do this is with hidden presuppositions that should be stated to clarify the argument. This however is not by concern. There are logical reasons to have an uncaused first cause. It is logically necessary. People have come to this conclusion without any religious motivations, people such as Plato and Aristotle. Even this is not my concern, to even debate this would be to follow your Red Herring.
The only thing that I am concerned about is your last statement. You said " you can not logically provide an argument for intelligent design without referring to the bible." This is completely false, you should study a bit more. There are several trained scientists who have provided good empirical evidence to support the intelligent design hypothesis. You should look into their work, then rephrase your statement.
You should read Michael Behe's work. He wrote a good book called 'Darwin's Black Box'. Also look into
William Dembski's work and the work of Stephen C. Meyer. These are just a few educated people who have built arguments in support of intelligent design with out using the Bible.

1) “The man who never reads will never be read; he who never quotes will never be quoted. He who will not use the thoughts of other men's brains, proves that he has no brains of his own.”-- Charles Spurgeon. The reason why I only referred you to the knowledge of other people, is because their thoughts and research go way deeper than my layman knowledge. Micheal Behe is a biologist, the only thing that he is going to do is formulate a hypothesis and provide empirical data. This is why I also referred you to William Dembski, and Steven C. Meyer. They are philosophers who provide additional evidence for Behe's hypothesis. My basic point was to show that your statement is false. "you can not logically provide an argument for intelligent design without referring to the bible". If any person was to read these peoples work, they would be able to recognize that.
2) When it comes to the whole who created God subject. You are absolutely correct, people who provide you with explanations like that are not providing you with much of anything. However, I will say that the question of who created God has no bearing on the debate subject; the universe could have been designed by a god who was designed himself. This is not the case, I will give you some logical arguments that demonstrate why God is and must be uncreated. There are several arguments that I could select, philosophers have been thinking about these arguments for centuries. Here is one that was produced by Aristotle in the late 300 B.C., but modified by Thomas Aquinas in the mid 1200 A.D.
Here the argument is in syllogistic form.
The argument from motion:
1. Things do move. Motion is the most obvious form of change.
2. Change is a passing from potency to act (i.e. from potentiality to actuality)
3. Nothing passes from potency to act except by something that is in actuality, for it is impossible for a potentiality to actualize itself.
4. There cannot be an infinite regress of actualizers or movers. If there is no First Mover, there can be no subsequent motion, since all subsequent motion depends on prior movers for its motion.
5. Therefore, there must be a first, Unmoved Mover, a pure actualizer with no potentiality in it that is unactualized.
6. This is understood to be God.
Here is one more syllogistic argument from Thomas Aquinas.
The argument from possibility and necessity.
1. There are beings that begin to exist and cease to exist (i.e. possible beings)
2. But not all beings can be possible beings, because what comes to exist does so only through what already exists. Nothing cannot cause something.
3. Therefore, there must be a Being whose existence is necessary (i.e. one that never came into being and will never cease to be)
4. There cannot be an infinite regress of Necessary Beings, each of which has its necessity dependent on another because
a.) An infinite regress of dependent causes is impossible. For unless there is a first cause of the series there would be no causality in the series.
b.) A Necessary Being cannot be a dependent being.
5. Therefore, there must be a first Being that is necessary in itself and not dependent on another for its existence.
I hope that these are more logical than the normal responses that you have been getting on this subject.
p.s. I want to say again that I am sorry for my attitude, in my first post. And thank you for correcting me.",7,0,"Intelligent design is logical"
4493,evolution,"I have not read the above posts but i am arguing from the point that intelligent design is a fallacious argument.
Firstly lets look at what intelligent design is meant to be. It's meant to be a science. However i don't really see what is scientific about pointing at things that the evolutionairy theory cannot yet explain, and purporting the existence of a designer by default. That is simply ludicrous and reductive. Also those who advocate intelligent design seem to point at the most obscure things. They don't however point at humans or at snakes or birds, whose existence is expalined very well by the evolutionairy debate. (Those wishing to mention the complexity of the eye should research evolutionairy explanations for it, and see that the theory accounts for the evolution of the eye perfectly well).
Intelligent design falls apart when trying to explain even the most basic things. Why is it when you cut open a whale or an anaconda, you find the last remnants of a leg bone. A useless pointless bone. A similar argument could be used as to why humans have an appendix. A useless pointless time bomb of a gland. Intelligent design falls apart when it tries to explaiin these occurences. Let's see what the most logical answer would be. Was it A God was drunk. Or B the whale is a mammal who used to live on land who adapted to live in the sea, and humans used to be herbivores in the evolutionairy past, meaning they needed an appendicts to help digest the food.
Also please don't refer me to read the works of those who advocate intelligent design. There biased and subjective. They quite clearly believe in there religion very strongly, making there work very subjective, when science is supposed to be objective.
Intelligent design is a religious adaptation to the American constitution. As religion is banned from being taught in American schools, and religion relies on spreading itself through indoctrinating the credulous children of the world, intelligent design is the logical conclusion to a doctrine trying to adapt itself to the modern world. Intelligent design fails to explain even the most simplistic of observations like why humans share 99% of their DNA with chimps. Evolution expalins these things perfectly",7,0,"Intelligent design is logical"
4732,evolution,"There is only two possibilities, ether it was a conscious mind or an unconscious thing. Based on observation of the world around us things move as a result of a conscious mind. If a conscious mind does not act upon an object that object stays static. When we consider nature, wind moves things, planets rotate, etc. The cause of this movement is unknown. Based on observation of the world around us it is not unreasonable to conclude that some conscious mind (being) is responsible for the motion of the universe. The only other option is that some unconscious thing is responsible for the motion of the universe. This, however, runs contrary to everything that we observe in the world around us.
As far as the Necessary Being is concerned. In the context of the argument a possible being does not have to be a conscious entity. It is anything that comes into existence. However, the Necessary Being must be conscious, because some of the beings that emanate from it are conscious. This is not unreasonable, we have never observed an unconscious being produce a conscious being. Those are the only two options either the Necessary Being is conscious or it is not. It is more reasonable based on common knowledge that this being must be conscious.",7,0,"Intelligent design is logical"
4732,evolution,"I was not trying to say that the cause of the wind was unknown. What I meant was the cause of the motion of the universe is unknown. We know that all motion started at the Big Bang when all space, time, and matter were produced. This includes gravity, atoms, and everything else that produces motion in our universe.This is the first motion. This is the motion that the argument from motion focuses on. What produced the first motion? Based on observation it is reasonable to say it was by a conscious mind (being).
"However, the Necessary Being must be conscious, because some of the beings that emanate from it are conscious. This is not unreasonable, we have never observed an unconscious being produce a conscious being."
Nor have we observed a conscious being create a universe, (or anything out of nothing) yet this is reasonable to conclude?" So based on what we experience everyday in reality, is that conscious beings produce conscious beings. It is not unreadable to conclude that the Necessary Being must be a conscious mind.
You base your conclusion off of your own preference, you do not have any observable facts to back up your conclusion. This is unreasonable and a large leap of faith. Not to mention that science says that the universe came into being at a finite time. Making the universe a possible being.
1. There are beings that begin to exist and cease to exist (i.e.
possible beings) THE UNIVERSE
2. But not all beings can be possible beings, because what comes
to exist does so only through what already exists. Nothing cannot
cause something. THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT BE CAUSED BY NOTHING.
3. Therefore, the universe can not be the Necessary Being.
Based on everything that we know about our universe and logic. I am completely justified and reasonable to conclude that a conscious mind caused the beginning of the universe.",7,0,"Intelligent design is logical"
