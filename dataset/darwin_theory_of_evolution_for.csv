32;evolution;"Debates are based on convincing evidence. There is very little evidence supporting creation, while there are massive amounts supporting an evolutionary argument. Creationism is supported by numerous ancient stories, some similar to each other, some wildly different from each other. But none of these stories are corroborated by any actual evidence. Since these are very ancient stories, they were first told by ancient peoples, with far a less sophisticated understanding of the natural and scientific world. Evolution is not a story. It is a scientific theory, posited to explain the development of life on Earth. The theory itself is evolving as new evidence arises. Certain parts of the theory are perhaps discarded, and new parts are added. This is how science works (ideally). We progress towards scientific truth by a series of incremental advances, sometimes punctuated by a huge advance. The theory of evolution is one such huge advance. And now, it is experiencing its own incremental advances.";7;0;2;Evolution
74;evolution;"Science! we win";7;0;2;Evolution
448;evolution;"This is a non-argument. The earth is not 10,000 years old and dinosaur bones were not put here to 'test our faith'. Religion has been putting forth explanations as to the origins of the universe since humans have even begun to think about it. We dont need those old myths anymore about dead gods and fairies, humanity has come up with a quantifiable way of testing our hypotheses. Now, i will not sit on my ivory chair and say that science gives absolute facts, (i dare you creationists do the same) it is a process by which we can evaluate data and come up with a better understanding from that process. Nothing is ever fact, but we can come up with a good idea of what information to trust because of scientific rigor. Thank you and goodnight.";7;0;2;Evolution
21;evolution;"Oh come on, are you kidding me? Are ou trying to tell me that a magical man who lives in the sky and is invisible except for people that have died can see him in the magic white puffy village called Heaven? I hardly believe this, especially since if creation is how we were made, how was "God" made? Obviously evolution makes more sense. Besides, if Adam and Eve were the first people on Earth, who were their parents? Were they brother and sister? Doesn't the Bible say something about how having sex with your sibling is wrong? Do I smell contradiction? I think I do...";7;0;2;Evolution
510;evolution;"The problem with supporting any religiously founded theory against science is: which religion do you believe? Chiristianity teaches one thing, hinduism teaches another, odinism teaches another and the peoples of various african tribes believe differently to each other. Why is any one view on how man was created more valid than any other? That's right, it isn't. Evolution is a plausible theory, supported by boundless evidence that seems to have very few chinks. I know faith is not meant to be based on evidence, but I can't see why in the face of such a huge amount of evidence to the contrary faith is still used as a solve-all to a non-existant problem. We're pretty sure where men came from now, so there's no need to invoke the Sky Daddy, the ever shrinking 'God of the Gaps' in this instance.";7;0;2;Evolution
1221;evolution;"It is important to understand that evolution is both a fact AND a theory. The current theory, based on Darwin's research, describes the facts of evolution, as based on verifiable evidence. If another theory comes along to better explain the mechanism(s) of evolution, it wouldn't nullify the fact that evolution occurs, things will continue to evolve. A great parrallel is Einstein's theory of gravity replacing Newton's - gravity didn't cease to function or behave differently when the theory was updated based on our improved understanding - that's what is great about science. It is open to skepticism, looks to be challenged and replicated and verified - but all the while basing everything on evidence. That is one thing creationism lacks. And to believe in something for which there is no evidence or proof is just intellectual dishonesty.";7;0;2;Evolution
1221;evolution;"I would be interested to see you cite your references for your comment that "a large amount of science communities believe in a creationist version of evolution." I would wager that not a single evoutionary biologist believes that. It's important to understand that evolution is NOT an explanation for the creation of the universe. That is still a great mystery, but we're making progress everyday via science in our understanding of the origins of the universe. Just because science can't explaing something now, doesn't mean a supernatural being can. There have been many things over the centuries that were once unknown or misunderstood that science eventually was able to explain (the source of lightning, gravity, what the sun is made of etc.) And just because you need to lean on a supernatural explanation for something because science has yet to explain it or it's hard for you to believe, doesn't make that supernatural explanation true. Provide evidence to support that belief, and I'll change my stance :)";7;0;2;Evolution
812;evolution;"Define "order and detail." Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent "The God Dilusion," and equally well written.";7;0;2;Evolution
1203;evolution;"Your main point is irrelevant. If creationism just explains the "moment that started it all," then it is compatible with evolutionary theory. This is because evolutionary theory is a theory concerning the origins of complex organisms that we find today. It is not a theory about the origins of life in general, and it is certainly not a theory about the origins of simple microorganisms. (It is also not a theory about the origins of the universe.) Evolutionary theory is perfectly compatible with the claim that some divine creator "touched" some primordial bog and out sprang a batch of microorganisms. Evolutionary theory is only committed to saying that life as we know it today is the result of these simpler organisms being subject to mutation and selection pressure. I don't see any urgent need to address your claim that "evolutionary theory" is problematic because it gets to change its story whenever it runs into trouble, because it isn't clear to me that you understand what evolutionary theory is. But I will say something about it briefly. "Evolutionary theory" is a general theory about how life as we know it came about, and there is no real evidence against it. You should think of evolutionary theory as being analogous to the scientific view that matter is made up of smaller things (e.g., atoms). Lots of theories about atoms have been proposed, and most have been false. But this doesn't refute the general theory that matter is made up of smaller things. Similarly for evolutionary theory. My guess is that you are confusing some particular theory about the origins of some particular organism (or part of an organism) with evolutionary theory, but that is a mistake.";7;0;2;Evolution
1221;evolution;"It's interesting that you mention Charles Lyell when arguing for the case of creationism, as he was a close personal friend of Darwin and was one of the first prominent scientists to support Darwin's book "The Origin of Species" (TOoS) - although he never fully accepted the idea of natural selection. Lyell even offered an endorsement of TOoS in one of his own books. As for the suggestion that there is no scientific rigor in evolutionary theory - have you read TOoS? Are you aware that scientists and others have been trying (rigorously?) to refutre or rebuff Darwin's theory for the past 150+ years and have yet to be able to do it? And P.S. - dating rock strata is not evolutionary theory, or even related. That would be the field of geology - evolutionary theory was/is the cornerstone of the field of biology as we know it today.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"Wait a minute. Sure, an ape is concrete. But evolution isn't. The ancients believed in God, and I'm sure they also believed in apes. God is not really that abstract either. Unbelievable, yes. But abstract, not really. It seems quite natural for ancient peoples to have believed in supernatural forces in order to explain lightning, thunder, fires, floods, etc. However, I'm quite sure the first peoples didn't think "Hey! God just made some lightning strike!". They probably revered these natural phenomena as being supernatural. As language was acquired, they put names to their supernatural beliefs, and along came the gods. Evolution is not an easily observable process, but it can be observed. When and where can God be observed? When does he "show himself"? If the story of Adam were indeed true, OF COURSE he would say God created him! He chatted it up with God on numerous occasions in the garden? (Also, I'm quite sure there were no apes in that region of the world.)";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"Come on quantum! Why are you now trying to apply evolutionary theory to geopolitics and sociology? Evolution is a theory of biology! Please try to get your facts straight. If the creationist camp actually had some decent arguments, this could be a real debate, but you guys always throw a bunch of dung around. Have you no pride? Geez.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"There is even embryological evidence of evolution. The human embryo goes through certain stages where it has a tail-like appendage, as well as a primitive gas bladder-like structure (ie. fish have these.) Many religious people shy away from evolution because of the "We came from ugly apes?!?" syndrome. Well, we also come from really very ugly embryos. If we are made in God's image, perhaps he resembles a large embryo. Many animals look almost identical at the embryonic stage, so maybe there's a message there. (Yes, this is the kind of science creationists like!) God created us and the animals, we and the animals share a common look when we're quite young, therefore God looks like an embryo. Sorry, just went a bit crazy there for a minute. Anyhow, check out "prenatal development" and "lung" on Wikipedia for some facts about this.";7;0;2;Evolution
1217;evolution;"Evolution is a man doing a very big jigsaw puzzle. Creationism is a man looking over his shoulder who thinks that the puzzle can't be done. Evolution has hundreds of pieces connected, he can see a lot of the picture already. Creationism points out pieces that don't fit, and tells him that he should give up doing the puzzle if pieces don't fit. Evolution looks harder at those pieces to find where they do fit, because he knows they must fit somewhere. Creationism says he'll never find where they fit, because they’re from a different puzzle and he's making the wrong picture. Evolution looks at the almost complete monkey's face, the almost complete banana, the almost complete words "L*OK, I'M A HAIR* LIT*LE M*NK*Y!" and frowns. Creationism says "It's a picture of God, and the words should say "God did it."” Evolution carries on with the puzzle. Creationism goes off to make his own puzzle and to bully jigsaw makers into putting bits of his puzzle in the same boxes as the one with the monkey.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"As to whether _______, each person has to decide for themselves. Hmm... As to whether I can turn myself inside out and survive, I decide that I can! But wait a minute! Just because I decide that it's true, that doesn't make it true!! So now, just because some religious folk look around and don't understand the natural world (like the cavemen didn't), and further because they don't even WANT to understand the natural world, there MUST be a god. Wow - I could claim anything this way. ("I don't understand how a computer works - God did it. I don't understand how an airplane works - God did it. I don't understand my homework - GOD!!") So now a few billion years is a short time? Ok. So how many years would be about enough in your expert opinion? If there were only one planet in the universe, then yeah, I'd agree with you - chances are pretty much nil that life like us would appear. But how many billions of planets are there out there? Quite a few. That increases the probability quite a bit. Where's your soul by the way? If your arm gets amputated, does 1/6th of your soul go along with it? Or does your soul stay comfortably in your brain somewhere, in among the cells and atoms? What the heck is a soul anyhow? Please share.";7;0;2;Evolution
1232;evolution;"Life has been around for billions of years. Any failure to recreate it in a laboratory is purely because researchers have failed to devote those same billions of years trying. :)";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"Wikipedia's article on "Recapitulation Theory" indicates that anti-evolutionists often use it to weaken support of eveolutionary theory. Sure, Haeckel's Strong Recapitulation Theory (ie. an embryo goes through every stage of a species' evolutionary history) is not believed to be true, but the article also states there are numerous connections between the growth of an embryo (ontogeny) and the evolution of that embryo's species (phylogeny). Specifically, referring to my previous gas bladder point, the human fetal lung develops from an outpocketing of the upper intestines. The gas bladders of fish have evolved over time from sacs of the upper intestines. This is also true of terrestrial vertebrates, their lungs have evolved from sacs of the upper intestines. If needed, I'm sure people will help me find the numerous other examples. Although apparently layman-unfriendly, I'm sure we can all figure them out. And if we can't understand the examples, maybe God is responsible after all.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"What - is God coming in the year 2100 to judge us then? Not in 2000? Why would God have to tweak anyhow. The guy is all-powerful. So he created some single-celled organisms billions of years ago, and then said to himself "I'm going to set this thing called evolution going and see what happens. Yes, I'll tweak these tiny organisms a bit. Then maybe humans will evolve some day and I can make Mary give birth to Jesus." Yes, that all makes a lot of sense. A good use of God's time.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"I think someone has already addressed your issue with scientific theories changing to accommodate evidence. There is nothing wrong with this in the realm of science. This is a great thing. If you've got something a bit wrong, or if you don't have the entire picture, bring on some new information. Sure, some scientists with big heads might reject modifications to existing theories, but if the modifications better explain the phenomena, those big-headed scientists will be dead someday, and science will win. Let's talk about "change" in the realm of religion for a moment. I haven't seen a more changeable system in the history of the world. Talk about compliance and flexibility! Let's start with one of the oldest current religions: Judaism. So God told these people a bunch of things and everything was great. Then Jesus comes along with his shtick, changes a bunch of stuff. Then Mohammed. Then all of the changes in Christianity happen. You've got sects in Islam. A billion different Christian churches. If there is a God, he's pissed at every last one of you religious types who have ignored what he told the Jewish people (I'm not Jewish by the way). The first folks he spoke to must have got the correct story, don't you think? Anyhow, all I'm saying is that if there is a God, then we should all be fundamentalist believers, still in a 500 B.C.-type world.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"I almost clicked "convinced"! Such a good argument! I think this debate shows that a number of humans on the right hand side are devolving. (kidding!) However, aren't you aware that evolution can take a long time? In some species, it can be relatively quick, but in most it takes eons. Do longer life expectancy and greater height in humans qualify as evolution? If in fact humans are no longer evolving (but I'm not sure anyone could prove or disprove this), it could be because we've taken control over our environment. We have no real natural predators, and (ignoring some aboriginal peoples scattered here and there) we no longer live in a natural state.";7;0;2;Evolution
83;evolution;"Sean, I hear what you're saying and definitely agree with your point about evolution and Creationism not being mutually exclusive. However, the old "this couldn't happen by chance" argument just doesn't work to defend Creationism, in light of recent scientific findings. Consider a crude version of the famous Drake Equation: 1. Age of universe: 13.7 billion years 2. Galaxies in universe: about 150 billion 3. Stars per galaxy: about 1 trillion 4. Planets per star: about 5 Just multiplying out these numbers would set my calculator to ERR: OVERFLOW. Basically, the point here is that life as described by evolution didn't necessarily have to happen on Earth, so it's ridiculous to confine our analysis to this one planet (especially given the gagillions out there!). When you consider the vastness of the universe, the odds don't seem so bad. It's also important to note that Creationism is an argument that came from a time when humans believed the earth was the center of the universe (which consisted of the sun and a few other planets).";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"Why don't we have talking monkeys? What kind of a question is that? (Are all you creationists pulling your questions from a "How to argue with an evolutionist" pamphlet?) Why don't chickens migrate? Why don't polar bears live in Africa? Because they don't!! Species have certain characteristics and properties. Primates evolved from a common ancestor. Human primates are the only ones who evolved speech. And it's not because we got tired of making monkey sounds! You can't choose to evolve a certain characteristic. I didn't realize monkeys were oppressed. Sure they're hunted by poachers sometimes, but they can't simply decide to evolve speech and say "Hey! Stop hunting us please!" You CAN see species in the process of evolving. Look around! Pick an animal. See - it's in the process of evolving. There are also some species of insects where we can witness evolution in very short time intervals. Planet of the Apes? Can I hail an insult at you? Because this kind of point is so juvenile. Talking monkeys and apes warring against humans... Good argument... Global warming: Again, you're totally confused about how evolution works. You can't just pick an environmental problem and suggest that humans should be able to actively evolve to combat it. However, it is quite possible that if radiation from the Sun becomes a huge problem, that people of certain skin types might be selected for survival and others not. And again you misunderstand evolution. It is not a way to make humans better. It is not a method of making any life forms "better". It's a way for animals who are best suited to their environments to thrive.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"There is not God. I just use him in my arguments to make sarcastic comments. Sorry.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"I think you might have been referring to my tone. Yes, I get a little worked up by these arguments. Sorry if I offend. However, I don't think standard "polite" argument is going to convince any creationists that evolution is true. Creationists have been brainwashed by forces in their childhood. From birth, they have been indoctrinated with false truths. To reverse this, they need to be shocked out of their stupour. Of course, what they really need are sessions with a psychiatrist, perhaps with shock treatment. I think we might need to redefine Creationism for the purposes of this debate. Shouldn't it be limited to the appearance of humans in the historical record? Evolutionists: "Humans evolved over millions of years from earlier forms of life." Creationists: "Man was created by God in the Garden of Eden and Woman was created from one of Man's ribs." Or have creationists accepted all of the scientific evidence of evolution?";7;0;2;Evolution
87;evolution;"This is pretty ridiculous. How can you argue against pure facts, with some random belief that someone made up years ago? People believe what they believe because they are told to by their parents, as they were by theirs. Anyone with a reasonable IQ can tell its all fairytales. Most people believe in Father Christmas at a very young age, but we all know how ridiculous that is.";7;0;2;Evolution

I remember at the age of 7 when I started questioning the Lord's Prayer in school. And God. It didn't make sense. So I stopped assuming God was real, and stopped saying the Lord's Prayer (thankfully my public school system stopped that practice). So please tell me where I have been brainwashed.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"Why don't monkeys talk? On its own, it's not a stupid question. It involves looking at a monkey's evolution, the evolution of their throats, etc. However, when you ask a question like that and try to use it to disprove evolution, it becomes a stupid question. Have squirrels been the same for 10000 years? How about a million years? Do you know anything at all about evolution? Have you heard of mutation? Selection? In the case of the insects I mentioned (the English peppered moth) we see selection at work. The moths were generally light-coloured and would blend in with the light-coloured lichen and trees. However, during the Industrial Revolution, the lichen died from pollution, and the trees were covered in dark soot. The light moths (which had alleles for dark wings in their genetic make-up) started being easily picked off by birds. This natural selection bumped up the percentage of dark-winged moths by a huge amount. Then as air quality improved the light-coloured moths increased in numbers. Please read a bit before contributing to a debate.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"I am always amazed how creationists can explain away the wonders of the Universe with a simple "God did it". We've got legions of scientists working on all of these questions. How did life start from a barren planet? How did the Universe come to be? How did humans appear? These people are actually trying to get to the bottom of these questions. But then you have creationists and other religious types, who debase all of science, and even of humankind, by going down the lazy route. They ask a bunch of questions, but don't want to bother with the answers. This has happened all throughout history. And Science has always come out ahead. Science has grown into an enormous explanatory machine, pushing religion into a tiny corner. I guess it's too much to expect this generation's group of religious people to change. But history shows us that their arguments and beliefs will vanish into thin air once the next generation's scientific discoveries occur. I have to give it to them though. They are a persistent bunch. If there really is a god, I'm sure he's quite proud of them. But what a strange god, wasting all of our time, allowing us to have these types of discussions.";7;0;2;Evolution
1203;evolution;"Again, you don't seem to understand something that is fundamental to the debate. You write: "And while there is significant evidence to support this theory, there is little evidence of how it started. How did a lifeless planet "form" life? What was the first starting point? The first formation of an organism from various building blocks? The first generation to "pass its genes" to the next? For these questions, Evolutionary theory has no answer." Let me repeat what I said before: evolutionary theory isn't a theory about how life got started! Darwin was not theorizing about the origins of microorganisms. His theory is a theory about how complex life, as we know it today, developed. The question of whether man evolved from apes is not a question about the origins of apes. Similarly, the question of whether man evolved from tiny microorganisms is not the question about the origin of tiny microorganisms! This point is absolutely essential. If creationism only holds that God created the first batch of microorganisms, then creationism and evolutionary theory are entirely compatible.";7;0;2;Evolution
878;evolution;"You can actually see evolution happen. Fruit Flies are quite useful for this experiment since the breed, live, and die so quickly. You have to understand evolution happens because of mutations and they survive because those mutations have made it easier for the creature to survive then the others. ie. natural selection. Speciation is also an example of evolution... different species come about because they have adapted to a slightly different enviroment. If you look you can see evolution";7;0;2;Evolution
878;evolution;"What makes creationism more valid then how say the aztecs think we came into being?";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"How do you know both moth colours have always been there? Do you know this for a fact? What if the dark colour appeared as a mutation at some point in the moth's evolutionary history? It stuck around in the genetic code but was rarely expressed. Then the darkness was selected for when the environment changed during the Industrial Revolution. If an organism's appearance changes due to external influences, that's evolution. I don't think you're familiar with peppered moths, evolution, or science in general. Which is unfortunate. You could also look at viral evolution, and bacterial evolution. Here, we humans are the external force causing the evolution with our anti-bacterial cleansers (selecting for the strongest bacteria) and our various medicines for diseases.";7;0;2;Evolution
32;evolution;"Many fewer dark moths were around than light-coloured moths. The original peppered moth theory suggested that the light moths were much more visible to birds because of the darkening on their habitat. So in this scenario, the birds and Nature are doing the selection. I don't think the light moths would consider it good fortune that they were being eaten in droves while the dark moths were surviving. Again, it doesn't sound like you understand the basics of evolution. Please read about "natural" selection (and NOT from a creationism website.) Unfortunately, it seems that the peppered moth example is not the best example. Although probably a case of natural selection due to pollution and birds, it's not as clear-cut as the original literature suggests. A book by Majerus (Melanism: Evolution in Action) points to some weaknesses to the original peppered moth theory. This shows again the willingness of science to admit mistakes and renew the search for truth.";7;0;2;Evolution

1243;evolution;"Disclaimer, this rebuttal was written in a very tired state and with very limited knowledge of the topic, so if I seem ignorant - enlighten me - but if I seem incoherent/just plain stupid - ignore me. It's one thing in this statement that irked me (it might not really be relevant to the point of the statement itself, but still), the use of the fact that exactly how proteins fold is as of yet undiscovered as an argument against evolution. It had this effect me due to something I recently read in some 'scientific' magazine. Apparently creationism/intelligent design supporters were making a similar argument of this missing step in evolution. It seemed they were saying that they accepted the ideas of evolution up to the point of protein structure & the ideas about evolution & natural selection, etc. However, they (and nobody else) can as of the moment explain just how proteins fold, therefore (they concluded) there must have been some divine intervention in the folding. It just baffled me that anyone had the courage to claim something that ridiculous. Certain religious ideas, or explanations for how things work, seem to be based on a principle of, "We don't understand something so it must be God's/something divine's doing." This principle in itself is practically saying that all we know now is all we'll ever know. Which science has proved wrong on countless occasions, as discoveries are made all the time. Indeed, just because we can't explain something (protein folding in this case) with our current understanding of the process doesn't mean we won't tomorrow, or maybe the day after (or if we're unlucky, not in a long, long time). As for the purpose in life - isn't it the same as our goal in life, survival of the species? Although, I guess that's an entirely different debate of an entirely different nature.";7;0;2;Evolution

If I have a bias towards a logical understanding of the Universe and towards science, it's because I have seen the effectiveness of science in truly explaining how things work. Religious bias is much different. There is no evidence, only blind faith. What causes you to believe in "Jesus"? Why not the older Jewish religion? Or Hinduism? Why not the Greek or Roman Gods? There is no reason to believe in one of these religions and not the others. This is where childhood indoctrination comes in. If you were born in India, you wouldn't give two hoots about Jesus.

Unfortunately, science is getting some God research done, however unsuccessful (see a recent Discover magazine). Statistically, I think it could be shown that God doesn't exist. You could look at groups of religious people and non-religious people and compare rates of suicide, happiness levels, illness, depression, criminality, etc. I'm sure you would find no difference. ‚hf there was a God, the huge communities of people praying for this and that would surely have an effect on society. Science is trying hard to explain how the universe came to be, and is not providing any simple answers (like "God did it.") There is no obligation to do good in one's life, but let's hope that every sane person can see that society as a whole functions best when each of us does good. I don't need a god to tell me this. As for whether there is more to our existence than our one life, this seems to be an instance of fear of death. The "do good and get to heaven" idea is very similar to "eat all of your veggies and get dessert". It's simply a way to con people into doing good, instead of expecting it to come from each individual themselves. I don't "believe" in science, nor should you. Science is a method of discovery. You can practice it, you can read about it, but you shouldn't believe in it. Belief comes with a notion of permanence. If you believe in God, then that's it. The God shouldn't change to suit the whims of the current generation. God should be the same God as was a thousand years ago, nay, two thousand years ago! A progressive God doesn't make sense. God should know absolute truth and should have known it for eternity. All the religious people out there should be acting like the Mennonites. Science, by its nature, is not permanent. Science constantly proceeds towards truth, sometimes making a few back or sidesteps, but always regaining its footing. I am as amazed and enthralled by the mysteries of the universe as the next person. Was the Big Bang really the beginning, or has the universe constantly been expanding and contracting? Is there an edge to the universe, and if so, how can this be? Was there a beginning to time? All of these questions completely boggle the mind. Staring up at space at night and witnessing the vastness of it all is incredible. But, taking that awe and wonder, and answering those questions with a magic wand and some alien being (because that's what a god really boils down to be) is just so arrogant, and so juvenile.

But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time." 4.

At the start of the observation period, there were two morphs of the Finch, a large beaked morph and a small beaked morph. One change in the ecosystem favored the large beaked morph over the small beaked morph, with the latter nearly becoming extinct. A second change in the ecosystem favored the now nearly extinct small beaked morph, and within a short time it was the dominant morph, with the large beaked morph on its way to extinction. Finally, the ecosystem shifted again, and populations stabilized. Today, a third morph has appeared, with a beak intermediate between the large and small beaked morphs.

The effects of evolution can be felt in almost every aspect of our daily lives, though, from medical and agricultural dilemmas to the process of choosing a good mate. In medicine, there's the question of how long the antibiotics we take now will remain effective, given the relatively fast rate at which bacteria can evolve resistance to drugs. In agriculture, the need to protect this year's crops is pitted against the concern that doing so will set the stage for insects to evolve pesticide resistance.

259;evolution;"Creationism -- I am not an expert, but I believe that creationists claim that because of the complexity of the world(life forms, and the such), that an intelligent 'creator' must have designed things from scratch in order that everything may be complex. I do not think that creationists claim that god started evolution, but that god simply ordered these beings, as in the bible, to be. Evolution -- Evolution is a theory that attempts to explain how all this complexity in life could have come about without invoking a creator god. Charles Darwin wrote the book, "On the Origin of Species" wich produced various evidences and arguments in favor of evolution. I have read the book myself, and thus I can also say that the book does not invoke chance to explain the creation of complexity. Also, many scientists of the time did not accept the theory until experimental verification of the theory added more evidence. Experiments, did add more evidence, to the point that many critical thinkers accept the theory as validated. Both theories of Creationism and Evolution adequately offer good explanations for how complexity arrived in the world. Unfortunately, Creationism suffers from a small counterargument. Because creationism states that all life forms simply "came to be" by the divine will, we have a contradiction not with another theory, but with a scientific LAW that has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. The second law of thermodynamics, and the law of conservation of matter states that matter and energy, while being able to convert to other forms, is NOT CAPABLE of being either CREATED or DESTROYED. It is not possible that life forms could have been created at the most fundamental level. Creationism, to be valid, would have to provide an explanation for how god was able to rearrange pre-existing matter in order to even be useful. I have no doubt that if a god existed, he could do such a thing. However, the theory of creationism, as claimed by creationists themselves, is the science of proving that God CREATED the universe. Unfortunately, creationism remains completely silent on HOW god created it. Evolution, as explained in Charles Darwin's book, also provides an adequate answer to how complexity arose. The evidence is in favor of this theory, which is why it is at the top of the scientific community. The examples are in scientific archives, ect. Ask any well established scientist to explain evolution, and he could do it perfectly well. The only problem creationists seem to have with evolution, however, is that it explains complexity without recourse to God. If we are examining whether creationism or evolution is the correct theory that explains complexity in life forms, then creationism produces a clash with the observed laws of the universe, and evolution does not.

It is expected that as time goes and more work is done the ideas will change and make new predictions. Finally, your last statement about science providing whether science can provide meaning is a nonsequitor.

You're introducing more complexity just as we're at the brink of eliminating complexity altogether. God doesn't solve the problem, in other words. Furthermore, science being wrong about things is very, very healthy. The whole point of science is to continuously correct itself.

1246;evolution;"Every proposed instance of Irreducible Complexity has been refuted. For example, a potential explanation for the evolution of the eye was put forth in 'The Origin of Species' by Darwin himself, and there are living creatures that still have eyes using many of these earlier forms. Also, the bacterial flagellum, which Behe often put forth as a good example of Irreducible Complexity, has many similarities with the mechanism that viruses use to inject it's DNA into a host cell in order to replicate. What is the difference between micro-evolution and macro-evolution? Biologists don't really use those terms, and creationists seem unwilling to define them. That may seem like a minor difficulty but it is essential for the discussion to move forward. Species have been created in the lab, by the way, but creationists usually say that the examples only show micro-evolution.";7;0;2;Evolution

739;evolution;"Way to pull the oldest trick in the book. Humans may not be able to give a concrete answer. But that does NOT prove anything. We may not be physically evolving as much, or we may not notice it. For something to truly evolve, there must be a need. Trout grew angled fins to swim faster and escape predators. We are DEFINITELY evolving mentally. We are learning more and doing more. Who knows?If we colonize the moon, we may evolve to deal with the lower gravity.";7;0;2;Evolution
600;evolution;"We need to understand that the purpose of evolution is to not detect the scientific reasoning for the beginning of life on earth. As much though as the science world would love to know, evolutions purpose does not explain it. Now you said that evolution does not explain where the common anscestor came from, how it all began. Well, that's not the point of evolution, evolution is and explanation of how we've changed in time. So in that sense, creationism and evolution don't compare, or rather even debatable as to which one is correct. One thing we can agree on is that creationism is a belief that explains how everything started, whereas evolution is a scientific theory explaining how everything changed. Now, you also stated that evolution, being a "scientific theory" can change at any moment as new information is discovered. Yes, that is true. A scientific theory is as close to a fact as it gets. For example, gravity. Gravity is a scientific theory. We know that it happens now, has happened in the past, we have some good evidence as to why it exists, but it could change as the earth changes, but all information points to the fact that gravity exists. I mean, 2+2=4 is a fact, that will never change, no matter what happens. Now take evolution, all scientific information has pointed in the direction that evolution exists, it can change at any time as we learn new things about it, but we do know that like gravity, it exists and has existed. Evolution is complicated, but keep in mind, a lot can happen in millions upon millions upon millions of years. Who am I to say god didn't make everything the way it was, but then again, who are you to say that evolution isn't a perfect system? Perhaps through evolution is just the way in which god makes and changes things.";7;0;2;Evolution
600;evolution;"Oh no, I in no way believe that man should ever abandon its beliefs in a higher being. I myselft do believe in a higher being. In a way I do believe in creationistic aspects as far as the fact that I myself believe something of a higher being, something we do not know or completely understand, and perhaps ever will, created everything. So I hope i'm not forwarding the message to others that they shouldn't believe in god or something when I myself most surely do. And yes haha, you are very much correct in saying that people on this website don't really have the "qualifications" to make any legitimate or reliable claims. Honestly, the only qualifications on evolution I posses are that of a few college classes on it, and that's it. So I myself am no expert. And i'm also no expert on the thoughts of creationism. Now, however, what I am certain of is that there is a very large difference between a scientific hypothesis and a scientific theory. To hypothesize is to observe something, assume something about it testing it to be true. Scientific theory is to observe, test it to the full quantity of its nature, and to come up with an answer that is correct, but could change as the earth changes in time. I mean, those men you listed, as credible and correct as they are (being the founding fathers of science as we know it today) can't change the fact that gravity and evolution fall under the same realm of scientific understanding and reasoning. An apple falls from a tree, well, a plant grows. A new apple takes its place, a differen looking one, a new offspring is born, also different. And i'm not sure how else to put it other than to state again, the purpose of evolution is to not understand how we began, but who we began from. As far as my understanding of creationism is concerned, that is the belief of how we got here, how anything is anything. A belief system I don't completely not believe in myself.";7;0;2;Evolution
600;evolution;"Also. I don't think there is a very large debate as between which is correct, considering the fundemental beliefs of creationism and evolution don't quite give the same answers to one question, so they're hard to compare and debate against. It's when some people who refer to themselves as cretionists and make bold claims that dinosaurs existed 6,000 years ago is when I think people start to really debate to the two. That would be a better example of the two concepts intercepting and causing debate. Another time in which these concepts intercept and start large debate is when discussing if one or the other should be taught in school or not. But those are debates for other times. I think instead of "which is correct, creationism or evolution", it's a matter of understanding each and how they differ, how one is science-based, and one is faith-based, but that doesn't mean either are incorrect or wrong to believe. Forcing however one belief on someoneis wrong. (not that any of us are doing that in this debate, just as a general point to make).";7;0;2;Evolution

You of course look at me like I'm mad, and ask exactly who/what that is. I then tell you that Boojerwocky is the Creator of the universe, and he is actually the supreme creator of other Gods. And hey, I have here the sacred Book of Boojerwocky. It was given to me in a vision on a hillside. I was wishing I could have an understanding of the universe, and from the sky, like a comet at first and then slower and slower, a trail of light came toward me until this book was floating above me. I reached for it, and as I grabbed it a voice boomed to me from behind. I turned and saw a burning tumbleweed. It was talking! The burning tumbleweed say, "Yay though you hath wished long for answers, here I giveth unto thee the answers. Go, and tell others of the faith they must have. They must only believe. I am called Boojerwocky, and thou art my prophet." So I spend my time now going around telling people about the great Boojerwocky. He is the God of Gods, the ultimate creator.

An organism, animal, plant or whatever undergoes evolution over generations when faced with a problem to overcome i.e. becoming taller or shorter, growing hair or a tail, swiming or flying even gaining intelligence are all skills or atributes gained over time through evolution when faced with a problem. and I've heard that argument about dinosaur bones being "put there to test the faith of believers" and that seems like a weak argument to me, an argument that could be brought up when you have no valid argument to say. I've asked people knocking on my door spreading the "word of god", what reason has caused the most wars and un-natural deaths in the hystory of the human race? and the answer is religion, those going out and fighting in the name of god or whatever other deity, even surpassing natural disasters (which were caused by god if you asked those who believe) what the hell would apes (or any other animal) need lasers for? god changed the speed of light?????

1191;evolution;"A BMW being formed randomly out of car parts is not comparable to the order we see in the Universe. You are incorrectly viewing the Universe (in its current form) as the goal of its existence. However, this is a fallacy. Let's take poker as an example. Any poker player would surely admit that being dealt a pair of aces would be far better than being dealt a two and a seven. However, despite the fact that a pair of aces is better than a 2-7, the odds of being dealt one or the other is exactly the same. You are making the assumption that the order you recognize is the end goal, when that is not the case. Take your BMW example: if you threw all the parts into a giant pile, and left it there for "millions of years," some order would arise (heavier pieces would perhaps shift to the bottom of the pile, weaker pieces would break and give way to stronger pieces, etc.). Whether or not the order you expect or view as the end goal (in this case, a fully built BMW) occurs is irrelevant, as some kind of order would arise. The Universe could function just as well were it slightly different or even entirely different, it would simply differ from what you perceive to be the correct order.";7;0;2;Evolution
1191;evolution;"Let's go through your claims point by point, shall we? 1) Thermodynamics and the origin of the Universe We may never comprehend how the Universe came into existence for a fairly obvious reason: You are correct in your definitions of the laws of thermodynamics. However, the rub is that these rules are only considered universal laws within OUR universe. Therefore, they have no bearing on what occurred prior to the existence of the universe. In other words, the laws of physics as we know them didn't necessarily apply when the Universe came into existence. 2) Biogenesis Look at a simple cell. What are it's components? A hydrophobic phospholipid membrane enclosing a medium in which proteins are shaped according to chemical processes. In other words, inorganic components. "Life is just an extreme form of chemistry" (-Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson). Life is simply the complex chemical interactions that take place between inorganic components making up the whole. Even creationists must concede that we are in fact made up of inorganic materials (hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, etc. are not themselves alive, as we define it). They seem to work together so perfectly for 2 reasons: you are (incorrectly) viewing life as we know it as the end goal, and because the processes that didn't work phased out of existence. 3) Design? I'm not quite sure I understand this argument. Mammals are the only group that contain erythrocytes (red blood cells) that lack nuclei. Are you suggesting that all other vertebrates were designed with less thought? 4) Information? Again, I'm afraid i don't fully understand this point. Apparently, the fact that our cells self replicate in large numbers is indicative of a level of "information" that suggests some kind of design? The differentiation of cells is a result of a set of genes known as the HOX gene set. They are responsible for correct segmentation of an embryo into its workable form. At first, this is very generalized (i.e. assigning dorsal-ventral orientation) but over time become more specific (i.e specific organ tissues). This process is very well documented, and is the reason that we are shaped the way we are. I hope I have adequately addressed this point. The "information" you view as impossible is quite well understood actually. 5) Instantaneous Systems Your mistake here is assuming that these organ systems evolved at the same time or the same speed. Insects don't have a closed circulatory system (as we have), but they seem to make it alright on their own. You are once again viewing our species as it exists right now as the standard, when it is not. You also seem to be having trouble grasping the enormous amount of time it took for these systems to evolve. It appears that a simple heart in an open circulatory system (as insects have) was the starting point for our relatively complex circulatory system (although to a dolphin or whale, our circulatory system might appear quite primitive and ineffective). 6) Sex Your view of this topic is quite flawed. There was never a point where a non-chicken gave birth to a chicken. That isn't how evolution works. It is such a slow and gradual process over such a long period of time that the shift from non-chicken to chicken wouldn't be perceptible. Take dogs for example- at what point during the domestication of dogs did they become dogs and cease to be wolves? You would certainly agree that a golden retriever is different from a wolf, but by just looking each generation from one to the other, you would never be able to point to a specific line and say, "This generation is golden retrievers while the one that gave birth to it was wolves." Once again, you seem to have trouble grasping the concept of very gradual change. 7) Transitional forms Forgive me, but I'll use dogs as an example once again. Why are there no living examples of canines halfway between wolves and golden retrievers? Does this mean that no such animal ever existed? Of course not. Whether or not something is alive today doesn't have any bearing on whether or not it did exist (any extinct species is proof of that). Furthermore, Why is a platypus not a transitional form? It is the halfway point between mammals and reptiles (cleverly called areptile-like mammal). Additionally, There are examples of nearly every stage of our evolution, so in a way, they are transitional forms. There are nearly no gaps in the fossil record (astonishing in itself), and by their very nature, there would be not be many "transitional forms" found today, because they would have given way to modern animals. There is no wolf-golden retriever because we bred them into becoming golden retrievers. 8) Fossil Evidence I'm sorry but you are simply incorrect here. To use your examples of dinosaurs, we have fossils of the first "bird" archaeopteryx- a dinosaur with wings (still had teeth and a long tail). Additionally, fossils have shown that dinosaurs such as velociraptors were covered in feathers (feathers and scales are very similar structurally. This is why birds often have scaly legs resembling those of reptiles). There are thousands of what you would call "transitional forms" in the fossil record, but for some reason creationists like to deny this fact. Many modern animals have complete fossil records, horses for example. We have complete records showing horses evolving from small, three-toed animals with longs tails into the animals we see today. 9) Genetics I will simply dismiss this as another example of your inability to grasp how gradual the evolutionary process is. If wolves only have wolves, where did dogs come from? Why is every animal on the planet related? 10) Misrepresented statistics Take your example of the alphabet. It is somewhat flawed and overly complicated, I hope you'll allow me to simplify it. Instead of letters let's say you had 6 dice. Your example is equivalent to saying, "roll 6 sixes all at once." Obviously, this is a tall order (odds of this occurring is (1/6)^6 or 1 in 46,656). However, a more accurate representation of evolution would be asking you to roll 6 sixes, but you have as many rolls as you like, and when you roll a 6, you don't have to reroll that die. It would take only a few rolls to reach the goal of 6 sixes (you can try this at home if you like). Evolution isn't the random coming together of traits. It keeps traits that work, and gets rid of those that don't. I hope you do more research on your own, as all of your points are very easy to reconcile. All the "problems" that you have found have already been (often simply) explained. Please let me know if you think I didn't answer any of your questions sufficiently. Best of Luck.";7;0;2;Evolution

Even the writers of the Gospels never met Jesus, as they all lived decades after his death. A person claiming to know someone who have met or spoken to God is NOT sufficient evidence (known as "hearsay"). 3) Although there are examples of things existing despite our not being able to see them (i.e. wind, magnetism, gravity, etc.), the difference between these and God is that unlike God, magnetism or gravity have observable and predictable effects on reality. God does not have any predictable or observable effects on the world, his influence is tagged onto naturally occurring phenomena. 4) How do you know this? What evidence has been presented to support this fact? 5) Even so, Adam and Eve's children would have been brother and sister, and therefore you have the same problem. Although, the Bible seemingly ignores the need for Adam and Eve to have daughters in order for Cain and Able to have children of their own.";7;0;2;Evolution
1191;evolution;"Every form of life on Earth is evolving. Because conditions surrounding organisms are constantly changing, there isn't really such thing as being "done evolving." So, monkeys are also still evolving, as are humans. Fish aren't jumping out of the water and growing legs because that isn't how evolution works. The changes are gradual over many thousands of years. This does not mean, however, that there are no examples of fish that express traits the are most likely representative of past species that paved the way for terrestrial animals. The frogfish is a type of fish that has fins adapted for walking on the sea floor (here is a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcN4nfcletU). Mudskipper fish have long been known to spend much of there time above the water and climbing branches, and lungfish are able to cross large swaths of land because they breathe outside of the water using simple lungs rather than gills.

1191;evolution;"With all due respect, the idea that evolution is "a bird evolving into an alligator" shows that you have a profound misunderstanding of how evolution actually works. A bird evolving into an alligator makes no sense in evolutionary terms for a number of reasons. First, evolution takes place within populations, not individuals. My second, and main issue, with your answer is the nebulous definition of the word "kind." You describe dogs as being a "kind," but even within dogs (I'm referring to the Family Canidae, not the species Canis lupus familiaris), interbreeding is not as simple as you seem to assume. For example, the African Wild Dog has been found to be unable to breed with any other species of Canid. Does that mean it isn't a "kind" of dog? I would very appreciate like a definition of a "kind!" Furthermore, no animal has ever come from a phylogenetic line in which it does not fit (in other words, no animal has ever been born that is not related to all the animals that came before it), as in your example of a bird evolving into an alligator. That being the case, all dogs are found within taxonomic Order Carnivora, as are cats and bears. This is because all these animals are related to each other despite that fact that you would say that they belong to different "kinds." I implore you to do more research, and really try to understand what you deny so confidently. As I said before, I would greatly appreciate your definition of a "kind." Thank you.";7;0;2;Evolution
989;evolution;"By saying there is a creator it simply extends the problem, Sure, you think that materialism can't explain the formation of the universe so you propose the idea of a god. The problem is, now you have to explain that god. Saying there is a being that created all this order then not providing any rational/logical explanation of that being does nothing to explain. It makes the problem worse. Remember, the question regarding the formation of life is HOW not WHY. Explanations are the HOW not the WHY. Evolution answers the HOW. God CAN answer the WHY. It does not answer HOW. If you refuse evolution as an explanation on HOW life is present as it is today, then what is your explanation? Don't just say blindly "God created life" tell me HOW. Did he use magic? By what means, by what process did he create? Answer this and you have the first step towards an explanation. So far no theist has been able to do this.

Earth was a ball of gas that sooner evolved into what it is now. If it wasn't for the big bang, we (earth) wouldn't be here. So if it wasn't for dinosaurs and the process of evolution, we wouldn't be here. How in the world is it possible for a human to just randomly exist upon earth and create the human race? Let me ask this, did the planets just suddenly exist out of nowhere? No, it evolved from gas and other elements from the big bang.

1247;evolution;"Religion is science. Science begins at a theory, followed by evidence. Science is not arrogant and never claims anything is fact, just the theory with the least amount of evidence mounted against it. Religion and the stories and wild idea's it entails were simply the first theories offered by people to explain their very complex and often confusing surroundings such as something as big and unnerving as a solar eclipse to something as simple as what those twinkling lights in the night sky are. The reason why religion is such a persistent theory the fact that these first idea's were powerful, remember any first experience of your own. Any idea put in your head as a child and then come to find it was wrong... it's hard to let go, these first idea's are powerful and people want to believe them. Not only this religion is a powerful tool, the idea that there is an almighty being that not only created life but can destroy it is a very persuasive tool to make people give money, time and behave in certain ways. This is a whole different subject but watch Zeitgeist then come back to me and tell me how you feel about this subject. Right, diverged a bit there. I argue a whole new point, that creationism and evolution are both science and simply different theories. It is a persons right to choose one theory over another usually through the process of critical analysis and looking at the evidence available as well as the reliability of the process used to collect the evidence. However I agree with Dawkins that people who follow religion are taking the cop-out, I quote "Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence." Using this logic, I say evolution seems like the 'study' that is least flawed and has the least evidence against it. And to respond to drmack metaphor of a bmw, no it is unlikely a bmw could just throw itself together through chance, however many of the components of it did. Furthermore, not one of the components of a bmw is self replicating (which is a normal ability of a molecule if it's structure and chemistry allows it) thus they are not subject to external influences allowing certain variations (however small the difference be between individual molecules) to replicate more so than others. This process inevitably leads to more and more complex structures that are nothing more than a vectors of the replicating molecule (genes) and given the time life has had to evolve, I believe that it is VERY likely even the most complex biological structure has come about through what is essentially a chemical reaction followed by self replication. Quite a depressing, but liberating, outlook on life. I feel by denying evolution, you are denying the basic workings of life such as chemistry. Do you think the factories that produce our detergents, medicines and fuel are decoys to test out faith and these are in fact provided by a superior being? I doubt it. How do you explain how we breed an animal for our exact needs? Are you denying that we are choosing an animal to breed with another to exasperate a characteristic? You can't, the production of a whole new breed of animal can be seen by a person in their life span. Argue if you will but actually seeing evolution(albeit forced through out intervention) is fairly solid evidence, but I guess that means little to creationists, not fans of evidence?

Single mutations do not create new specie they do however create one step towards something which isn’t anything like its ancestors. After 1 million of these little changes would the new creature look like its ancestors 1 million years ago? No, so where is the new specie? You don’t notice a new specie if you only look at one generation. You need to look over a LONG period of time. That’s why creationists think there are no "missing link" fossils. They see the fossil and see fossils which come before and after and say, hey there not that different. That’s not a new specie.";7;1;2;"evolution is scientific"
167;evolution;"the flaw in the argument that evolution is not scientific is within your definitions of evolution. evolution is not the creation of new species. evolution is the adaptation of an already existing species to further its chances of survival and its chances to procreate. therefore, evolution can, and has been observed. a simple example is a non-particular species of birds. (this is a thought example mind you, only to demonstrate the concept) this species of birds is isolated on an island. within the population there are birds that have wide beaks and birds that have narrow beaks. now, we will assume that the birds with narrow beaks have an easier time finding food, be it insects or what have you, that try to escape by hiding in the crevices of rocks or trees. once all of the readily available food sources are gone, the birds are going to turn to those sources that have been hiding. since only the birds with the narrow beaks will be able to catch this food, they will live, while the fat-beaked birds will starve and die. thusly, the population of birds on this island will no longer consist of fat beaks and narrow beaks, but of only narrow beaks. that is an example of evolution, and it is observable over a long enough timeline.";7;1;2;"evolution is scientific"

1606;evolution;"First, the concept of species is an artificial construct. Being the primates that we are we like to classify things into categories and hierarchies. The Linnaeus classification system was created based on observed living organisms back in the mid 1700's which were distinct groupings. Another problem is the definition of what makes a species a species. This is a classification problem that still exists today. There are about 8 popular ones that usually cooperate together, but there are situations that it does not. The most popular of this definition is if there is natural reproductive action between the individuals of a given population. Please look up the experiment on the speciation of fruit flies in lab. You can not compare genetic relations like one does with family genealogy. A human with an A blood type is more related to a Chimp with an A blood type than with a Human with a B blood type, as far as that specific gene is concerned. Part of science is to investigate relationships and patters. The fact that Chimps have the most genetic information in common with humans, as opposed to the 70ish% with mice, is very interesting. Here is another example. You are correct in that we did not evolve from apes. We ARE apes. The Apes are classified as the family Hominidae, which we are members of. My final point.

You seem to have highlighted the flaw in your own assumptions. "Why adapt anyway?" Ah, it is this that appears to be your central misunderstanding. Unless you assume that everything is created with an express purpose dictated by an outside force (and even if you do, this can still apply), it is reasonable to assume that almost everything is more or less happening at random. When a child is born, is it born to an exact model? Can we say that a human child has fingers exactly 'so' long? Not at all - it's all chance. You just need to look at the level of mutations that occur on a regular basis in new babies, so much can go wrong in the (highly complex) process of growing a new organism that the variation between individuals is often vast. If, for one type of creature, a mutation that occurs fairly regularly proves to give the creatures carrying the mutation an advantage over those that don't (eg: the first apes with skeletons that allowed them to stand slightly more upright allowed them to spot predators more easily, and run quicker) then the creatures with the mutation will live longer, eat better, breed for longer and have more offspring. Over time then, the percentage of the individual creatures with the mutation will be increased, and the results will be compounded (eg: the apes that could stand most upright gained the most advantages, and so their offspring were more upright, then the most upright of those etc. etc. etc...). In this respect, human controlled animal is a perfect example - if you want horses with the best body structure for running, then you mate the best running horses available together - if you want dogs with long hair, you mate a long haired dog with another long haired dog. Yes, of course these 'advantages' are human induced, but its easy to see how a creature that can escape predators or find food better than its competitors has more offspring who are able to do the same thing than its competitor who can't.

DOES NOT say that IT is TRUE. However, it is the BEST currently available scientific theory (strict, scientific meaning of the word 'theory') which explains the undeniably observed facts. As more facts come about, the theory will be refined and/or corrected to account for them - this flexibility is ESSENTIAL to the scientific nature of a 'theory'. 2. DOES NOT claim that the driving mechanism of change is random chance. To the contrary, it is clear that random chance IS NOT this mechanism. It asserts that what drives evolution is NATURAL SELECTION. The two are not even a little bit alike. 3. DOES NOT claim that humans have evolved FROM apes. Not even a bit. It claims that humans ARE apes: a very particular species of apes, called homo sapiens sapiens, but an ape none the less. What makes us apes? Our physical features!

However, it is misguided to think that 'creationism' (fundamentalist, few K years old-Earth version) is an accurate description, reflective of any physical reality (as we familiarly understand these terms). Evolution is a scientific theory: as such, it is VERY EXPLICIT that IT is NOT 'the truth'!!!! ...whatever 'truth' may be.... To assert that is to NOT understand what a scientific theory is - or, indeed, the very point of one.

And that's exactly what they found when they looked: http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html "In fact, since evolution requires more advanced species have greater complexity, this would indicate the horse is more evolved than human (more chromosomes)." Absolute rubbish. The number of chromosomes is NOT related to the intelligence or complexity of the organism. A crayfish has 200 chromosomes. Does that make it smarter or more complex than you are? No (although crayfish are probably slightly more intelligent than creationists). "Mammoth is good example (turns out, not woolly and had tropical food in its stomach." Doh! There were several species of mammoth. You are probably talking about the 'Columbian mammoth', which was definitely hairless and ate tropical fruit. You could also be talking about the Steppe mammoth from Eurasia, which is also thought to be hairless, or at least - there's no evidence for hair. "This actually highlights a problem with evidence on both sides" No, the problem is only on the creationist's side. The scientific process is... ideas/observations hypothesis experiment/more observation data conclusion publish peer-review ... after which the idea is falsified or strengthened over time by hundreds of thousands of people working in the relevant fields. OK, so the process is not perfect, but it's the best we've got towards finding out the realities of our universe. Creationists have NEVER taken part in this process or published one paper to be peer-reviewed. Instead they make propaganda books, videos, and websites and pull political strings.";7;0;2;Evolution

3192;evolution;"Is Evolution True? For many years, I accepted naturalistic evolution as a given, a proven scientific fact. Even though I knew it was a theory, it seemed to make sense and explain the evidence. I participated in a field biology/ geology class in college during which a group of students spent over a month traveling around Colorado, learning the basics of scientific thought while stopping at road cut after road cut, digging fossils and seeing evolutionary evidence for ourselves. Creationists, I thought, were the ones who lacked a commitment to truth and objectivity, who ignored evidence because of prejudice or a belief system they felt a need to defend. Whether I wanted to believe in God or not was irrelevant to what was true. My commitment has always been to truth, whether I like it or not. I accepted evolution because I was unaware of the sum total of evidence and because I didn't know the questions to ask. I don't think I ever completely believed that God was just a figment of men's imagination, but I didn't argue with those who did. Almost twenty years after college, I listened to some tapes by creationists and was surprised to discover that they made more sense than I had expected. I decided to do more investigation. I read Origin of Species and dozens of books and articles on evolution and creation (view reading list and annotations). I searched out the criticisms each side had of the other and read the responses to those criticisms. My goal was to maintain an open mind and to consider all arguments without prejudice. To my surprise, I became more and more convinced that, although both sides had strong and weak arguments, natural evolution as outlined by Darwin can not account for what exists. This does not, of course, mean that the Bible is true, but it leaves the question open. According to biochemist Michael Behe, author of Darwin's Black Box: The conclusion that something was designed can be made quite independently of knowledge of the designer. As a matter of procedure, the design must first be apprehended before there can be any further question about the designer. The inference to design can be held with all the firmness that is possible in the world, without knowing anything about the designer. By the way, if any evolutionists read this and would like to open a dialogue, correct facts I may have gotten wrong, or present information that's become available since I did my study, I'd love to hear from you. I'm open to new information and committed to truth. In the course of my investigation, I tried to get my honest questions answered by evolutionists and was told not to get sidetracked by details. I should believe in evolution, I was told, because it is scientific. It reminded me of trying to get my questions about Christianity answered in high school. Then I was told I should believe the Bible because it is God's word. In both cases, no attempt was made to answer my questions. I was asked to accept prevailing thought based on authority alone. Details are important. In criminal investigations, a tiny detail that doesn't fit can lead to a whole new line of inquiry. A person committed to truth and objectivity cannot afford to ignore or brush over details that do not fit his preconceptions. Many serious scientists have always doubted the sufficiency of Darwin's theory, or have accepted it mainly because they couldn't think of a naturalistic alternative. For some quotations by famous scientists concerning the origin of life, click here. The evidence to support evolution is not overwhelming, as is often stated. I was surprised to find in my research that the same examples that were cited 30 years ago when I was in high school are still the best evolutionists have to offer: the peppered moth, sickle-cell anemia, etc. I had expected that by now there would be many more clear examples and much more "proof." Below is a summary of what convinced me that natural evolution cannot be the answer to the question of origins. Natural law. Scientists investigate the laws of nature. The very existence of law and order in the universe points to a source or lawgiver. Law of cause and effect. All current scientific evidence indicates that the universe had a beginning. Before this evidence was found, many scientists thought that the universe had existed eternally and had no beginning. According to the law of cause and effect, every effect must have a cause. Since we have an effect (the beginning of the universe and life), there must have been a cause. That cause would necessarily be outside the present realm of nature. First law of thermodynamics. The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. In the current order of nature, energy is transformed from one form to another, for example from nuclear energy (sun), to light, to chemical energy (in plants), to heat (when the food is eaten and the calories are used to warm the body), to motion (walking) or sound (speaking). Electricity is an additional form of energy. Energy can never be created or destroyed. This is not a theory, it's a law. Matter is related to energy (e=mc2), so energy can sometimes be transformed into matter and vice versa, but the energy itself cannot be created or destroyed. Since we have matter and energy, and since the universe has not always been in existence, energy had to have been created at some time in the past. Today's natural laws must not have always been in operation. Second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics describes the natural tendency of things to progress from order to disorder. This law states that order does not arise spontaneously from chaos. In other words, the universe is "running down." In the past, there was more usable energy in the universe than there is now. The same amount of energy exists because energy cannot be created or destroyed, but on the whole it is in ever less usable form. The theory of natural evolution proposes that over millions of years, the universe and life on earth naturally proceeded from chaos (disorder) to the amazing degree of order we observe today. Although scientists argue that the excess energy of the sun could have powered these improvements without violating the law, evolution would have required not one but hundreds of millions of small movements "uphill". Even a single incidence of this would be unusual! Note that the apparent uphill movement of a seed to a tree or a fertilized egg to an adult animal is not random. The seeds contain the design code and instructions for "building" the organism from available materials. The question is, can information come from nothing? Can information organize itself in an orderly way? Law of biogenesis. People once believed that maggots were spontaneously generated from the flesh of dead animals. They thought life could come from non-life. Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that life cannot arise from non-life. This is not a scientific theory, but a law. Proponents of evolution contend that life did arise spontaneously from non-life at least once in the past, in other words, that this particular natural law was broken or nonexistent sometime in the past. Complexity of living cell. A single cell is far more complicated than any machine intelligent man has invented. A typical cell contains ten million million atoms (quadrillion). To reconstruct a model of a cell, atom by atom, one atom per second, would take about ten million years to finish. To get a cell by chance would require at least 100 functional proteins to appear simultaneously in one place. Even if that happened, would it be alive? A dead body (or a dead cell) has all of the proper proteins, enzymes, the cell wall, and the DNA design in one place, yet it is not alive. Complexity of DNA code. The capacity of DNA to store information vastly exceeds that of any known system created by intelligent man. If the information in an individual's DNA were in small type in books like the telephone book, it would take a stack of books 46 feet high to hold all the information. Yet there is a DNA molecule in every one of the ten trillion cells in a human body. The design information to specify every person who has ever lived and every species of animal and plant which has ever existed would fit into a cup, with room left over. Sexual reproduction. Evolutionists often point out that humans and chimpanzees share 99% of genetic material. Yet humans have 23 sets of chromosomes and chimps have 24. For two animals to mate, their chromosomes must match or "zip together." The proposed divergence of chimps and humans from a common ancestor is said to have occurred after sexual reproduction began. If the theory of evolution is true, an animal must have been born at some time in the past with a different number of chromosomes than its parents. Unless that animal was able to mate, it would have no adaptive advantage. Therefore, if evolution as proposed is true, two animals must have experienced the same change in the number of chromosomes in the same geographic location during the same generation. Although "coincidences" such as this have not been observed in nature, they must have happened thousands of times in the course of history if natural evolution is to account for what exists today. Interdependence of proteins and DNA. The proteins needed for life cannot be manufactured without the design specifications of DNA. DNA cannot replicate itself without enzymes (proteins). According to atheist Richard Dawkins, "DNA and protein are two pillars of a stable and elegant arch, which persists once all its parts simultaneously exist. It is hard to imagine it arising by any step-by-step process unless some earlier scaffolding has completely disappeared." Such scaffolding is completely speculative. Complexity of the brain. Microelectronics, created by intelligent man, can pack more than a million circuits within a cubic foot. The brain has been estimated to pack a million million circuits per cubic foot. The human brain contains about ten billion nerve cells, each of which can put out between 10,000 and 100,000 connectors. The number of possible associations, hence the number of potential thoughts a person can think, may exceed the number of atoms in the universe. The brain is by far the most complex thing known to man. Probability. There are about 1070 atoms in the observable universe. There are only 1090 seconds in the 15 billion years generally said to be the age of the universe. The probability of spontaneously forming the smallest replicating protein molecule by chance is 1 in 10450. The probability of spontaneously forming proteins and DNA for the smallest self-replicating entity is 1 in 10167,626. The probability of a simple living cell reassembling itself under ideal natural conditions if all components were present but chemical bonds were broken is 1 in 10100,000,000,000. Mathematicians consider events in nature with a probability of less than 1 in 1050 to have a zero probability, i.e. to be impossible regardless of how much time is available. Mutations. Mutations are errors in DNA copying. They are very rare and 99.99% of them are harmful or fatal. DNA has a built-in "proofreading" system with such accuracy that a typist would each have to type 20 billion books with only one typographical error for it to be matched. The neo-Darwinian synthesis proposes that mutations are the primary source of improved genetic material. Natural selection can select from an existing gene pool that which is "fittest" for a particular environment. It does not even attempt to explain the origin of the material in the gene pool from which selections are made. Where did the huge variety of genetic information come from in the first place? Information must come from somewhere. It does not arise spontaneously. Adaptation or "fit" of organisms to their environment. In many cases, many interlocking parts would have to come about at once for any mutation to be functional enough to be naturally selected. An example is the bombardier beetle. When threatened by an enemy, it blasts boiling hot gases from two tail pipes into the face of an attacker. The explosive is made inside the beetle's body by mixing together two dangerous chemicals (hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide). In addition to these two chemicals, the beetle manufactures another type of chemical known as an "inhibitor." The inhibitor prevents the chemicals from blowing up and enables the beetle to store the chemicals indefinitely. When the beetle is approached by a predator, he squirts the stored chemicals into the two combustion tubes and at precisely the right moment he adds another chemical (an anti-inhibitor). This knocks out the inhibitor and a violent explosion occurs right in the face of the attacker. How could such as system, utilizing such dangerous chemicals, have evolved randomly step by step? All parts are necessary for any of them to have an adaptive advantage. The probability of more than one advantageous mutation arising at once is incredibly slim. Darwin himself wrote: If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. Convergence. The eye is an example of an extremely complex organ. Yet it is said to have evolved independently numerous times. Vertebrate eyes are imperfect. They're wired backwards and have a blind spot. Evolutionists argue that God would certainly not have designed them that way. Yet these imperfect eyes work better than any camera man has invented. By pure random chance, a single appearance of an eye would be highly improbable, impossible according to mathematicians. Darwin wrote: To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree. The ability to fly supposedly evolved spontaneously by chance at least four times: for insects, birds, mammals (bats) and reptiles. Yet intelligent man did not figure out the principles of flight until the past century. Transitional species. Many of what Darwin considered to be transitional species have been discredited. Even Archaeopteryx, once thought to be transitional between reptiles and birds, is not. Modern birds have been found deeper in the fossil record. For the most part nature's divisions are not blurred and indistinct, currently or in the fossil record. The phyla appear in the fossil record almost instantaneously in what is known as the Cambrian explosion, with no apparent connections. Transitional leaps. According to evolutionists, reptiles evolved into birds. Yet the lung of a reptile is very different from the lung of a bird. How could one design evolve into the other step by tiny step, with each step being an improvement over the previous one? Microevolution cannot be extrapolated to explain macroevolution. Microevolution (one species of bird to another closely related species) has been fairly well established. But no natural mechanism has been even been suggested to explain how macroevolution (from reptile to bird, for example) could possibly have happened. The Anthropic Principle. The more scientists learn, the more it appears that the universe is tailor-made for life. The more accurately and extensively astronomers measure the universe, the more finely tuned they find it to be. There are a minimum of 25 characteristics of the universe which must be "just so" for life of any kind to be possible. There are more than 40 characteristics which must be "just so" for life as we know it on earth to exist. Here are some examples: Distance from the moon to earth. If the moon were farther away, there would not be enough mixing of ocean waters by the tides. If it were closer, the tidal effects would be too great. Atmospheric electric discharge rate. If there were more lightning, there would be too much fire destruction. If less, not enough nitrogen would be fixed in the atmosphere. Rotational speed of the earth. If it were slower, there would be too much temperature difference between day and night. If it were faster, the wind velocities would be catastrophic. Surface gravity. If it were greater, the atmosphere would retain too much ammonia and methane. If it were less, the atmosphere would lose too much water vapor. Tilt of axis and distance from the sun. If it were different, the temperature variations would be too great to support a stable water cycle. Amount of water vapor. If it were greater, there would be a runaway greenhouse effect. If less, there would not be enough rainfall. Amount of carbon dioxide. If it were greater, there would be a runaway greenhouse effect. If less, plants would be unable to maintain efficient photosynthesis. If these things and many others were just slightly different, life as we know it would be impossible. C.S. Lewis wrote: In the science, Evolution is a theory about changes, in the Myth it is a fact about improvements. To those brought up on the Myth, nothing seems more normal, more natural, more plausible, than that chaos should turn into order, death into life, ignorance into knowledge. Science itself has proven that chaos does not naturally and normally turn into order. Life comes only from life (law of biogenesis). Things do not improve naturally as a matter of course (second law of thermodynamics). Things improve because of intelligent input. For example, the technology we enjoy in the present age is a result of human intelligence, not random chance. Science has given us a great deal, but not everything that exists can be explained scientifically. In the words of Phillip Johnson, What is presented to the public as scientific knowledge about evolutionary mechanisms is mostly philosophical speculation and is not even consistent with the evidence once the naturalistic spectacles are removed. If that leaves us without a known mechanism of biological creation, so be it: it is better to admit ignorance than to have confidence in an explanation that is not true. Of course, concluding that Darwinian evolution is not true does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Bible is true. That's a separate line of inquiry.";7;0;2;Evolution

3610;evolution;"Biological evolution is genetic change in a population, from one generation another, with continuous evolution over many generations often resulting in the development of new varieties and species. It is the mechanism in which species adapt or respond to environmental changes, and failure to do so, often leads to extinction. Most of Darwin's arguments for evolution, in his publication of On the Origin of Species, were based almost exclusively on evidence from living organisms. Then there is the fossil record, the diversity of living organisms...the peppered moth, fruit fly, and DNA studies...to mention just a sprinkling of the areas where overwhelming evidence has been compiled, supporting the "fact" and "existence" of evolution. This argument could easily be a debate about the meaning of "proof," "fact," and "theory." As I mentioned before, evolution is both a theory and a fact...because "theories" and "facts" are two different things...not rungs in a ladder of increasing certainty. Theories are models, or structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts are the world's empirical data. Facts do not go away while the evolutionists and creationists debate over their respective theories to explain them. The National Academy of Sciences defines fact to mean "something that has been tested or observed so many times that there is no longer a compelling reason to keep testing or looking for examples." There may be current questions about how life evolves, but the occurence of evolution as a fact, is embraced by most modern biologists.

Bacteria evolving to become immune to antibiotics. These changes are not merely adaptation they are referred to as MICRO Evolution. Evolution as a Theory, All current life forms on Earth have evolved from a single species. One Species over a long period of time and through many thousands of steps of MICRO evolution becoming a new distinct species. This is referred to as MACRO Evolution. So Evolution is BOTH a Theory and a Fact. To say that Evolution and Creationism stand on the same grounds is nothing less than nonsense. Evolution like all of the other disciplines of Science, puts forth a theory and gathers evidence to support that theory. If in doing so it finds enough evidence that proves the theory, great. We now have a proven fact. If in the gathering of the evidence it comes across evidence that contradicts or DISproves the theory, then the theory is either modified or proven false and thrown out. Creationism on the other hand starts with the ending and tries to gather evidence to prove that theory, ignoring or tossing out any evidence which contradicts or DISproves the preconceived conclusion. Much like shooting an arrow into a wall then later painting a bullseye around the arrow. Many have suggested that Science and Religion can co-exist, but many recent and yet to come discoveries are proving that to be an unrealistic compromise. To even consider putting Evolution and creationism on the same grounds would be like putting Astronomy and Astrology on the same grounds. Or giving equal weight to Chemistry and Alchemy. Lets face it, Science and technology are accelerating the Age of Enlightenment that we entered into a few hundred years ago at a breathtaking speed. And the Religious fundamentalists are being dragged kicking and screaming into the the future that casts doubt on many of their preconceived notions and disproves beyond a shadow of a doubt some of their most basic erroneous beliefs. They see this as an attack on their faith. Thus they protest progress. And the problem for many in society is this, Do we return to a religious Dark Ages and ignore reality and new discoveries by turning off our brains and saying "God did it? Do we let the religious superstitions of the past regain their hold and control over society and dictate what discoveries researchers may or may not proclaim? If so which researcher will be the next Galileo convicted and condemned for having the courage to make a discovery that contradicts religion?

The problem with this argument is that it's a form of radical skepticism. Sure, if every empirical sign signifies X is true, we can still say X is not true. You can always knock any empirical argument to a non-absolute truth. For instance, let's consider whether there's a thing called gravity. Is there? What proof is there? Well, every human would say they're more or less glued to the planet. But, so what, that's just people's experiences. And, if we get to a scale small enough, gravity seems to play no role at all in the forces of small particles. Here's gravity, but it has inconsistencies. Therefore, gravity cannot be a fact. In a sense, that's your argument. But that's not true. We can all accept that there are scientific issues with gravity, our understanding of the concept isn't perfect--whether that's for a lack of imagination, will, or intelligence is beyond me to comment. But just because we can't perfectly understand gravity it doesn't mean that gravity is not a fact. And, if it's not, then any empirical phenomena is not a fact. No system is perfect.

Wikipedia "Transitional Fossils" and you'll be greeted with hundreds (literally) of examples. You can look at the references the the foot of the article to check their validity. I guarantee you'll struggle to find any significant flaws, if any. (2) Say that you have two fossils: A and C. Now, in this case A evolved into C, but scientists/geologists haven't found any 'transitional fossils' to illustrate the change (even though DNA and molecular biology studies prove it beyond reasonable doubt). Then they find a perfect 'transitional fossil' that we'll call B. Creationists would now just say well you can't show how A evolved into B or how B evolved into C with fossils! Do you see? By finding a 'transitional fossil', you essentially just create another two gaps that 'are in need of filling'. By this logic, all fossils are transitional! I really find this argument frustrating, it's parroted again and again, but it's just so flawed. "...there is no direct proof to explain common lineages." But there is. When you examine the DNA of all the organisms, you find a perfect family tree forms. It is a pyramid of relation that you can quite literally place into a family tree that illustrates how all organisms alive today share a common ancestor. Humans and chimpanzees have a common ancestor, humans and snails have a common ancestor, humans and dandelions have a common ancestor, humans and Haemophilius influenzae have a common ancestor. I can't stress how elegantly it proves the familial lineage of the animal and plant kingdoms.";7;0;2;Yes

1189;evolution;"The ID movement is motivated by and inseparable from a narrow religious viewpoint. In the words of its founders and leaders: There's a difference of opinion about how important this debate [advocating intelligent design] is. What I always say is that it's not just scientific theory. The question is best understood as: Is God real or imaginary? (Phillip Johnson, "The Search for Intelligent Design in the Universe", Silicon Valley Magazine, 9 Jan. 2000.) "We are taking an intuition most people have [the belief in God] and making it a scientific and academic enterprise. We are removing the most important cultural roadblock to accepting the role of God as creator. (Phillip Johnson, "Enlisting Science to Find the Fingerprints of a Creator", LA Times, 25 Mar. 2001.) Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools (P. Johnson 2003). "Father's words, my studies, and my prayers convinced me that I should devote my life to destroying Darwinism, just as many of my fellow Unificationists had already devoted their lives to destroying Marxism. When Father chose me (along with about a dozen other seminary graduates) to enter a Ph.D. program in 1978, I welcomed the opportunity to prepare myself for battle (J. Wells n.d.). If we take seriously the word-flesh Christology of Chalcedon (i.e. the doctrine that Christ is fully human and fully divine) and view Christ as the telos toward which God is drawing the whole of creation, then any view of the sciences that leaves Christ out of the picture must be seen as fundamentally deficient. (William Dembski, Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science & Theology, Downers Grove, InterVarsity Press, 1999.) "Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory (Dembski 1999, 84). Johnson said he and most others in the intelligent design movement believe the designer is the God of the Bible (Maynard 2001).";7;1;2;Evolution
1189;evolution;"1) It is hard to understand how anyone could make this claim, since anything mutations can do, mutations can undo. Some mutations add information to a genome, some subtract it. Creationists get by with this claim only by leaving the term "information" undefined, impossibly vague, or constantly shifting. By any reasonable definition, increases in information have been observed to evolve. We have observed the evolution of * increased genetic variety in a population (Lenski 1995, Lenski et al. 1991) * increased genetic material (Alves et al. 2001, Brown et al. 1998, Hughes and Friedman 2003, Lynch and Conery 2000, Ohta 2003) * novel genetic material (Knox et al. 1996, Park et al. 1996) * novel genetically-regulated abilities (Prijambada et al. 1995) If these do not qualify as information, then nothing about information is relevant to evolution in the first place. 2) A mechanism that is likely to be particularly common for adding information is gene duplication, in which a long stretch of DNA is copied, followed by point mutations that change one or both of the copies. Genetic sequencing has revealed several instances in which this is likely the origin of some proteins. For example: * Two enzymes in the histidine biosynthesis pathway that are barrel-shaped, structural and sequence evidence suggests, were formed via gene duplication and fusion of two half-barrel ancestors (Lang et al. 2000). * RNASE1, a gene for a pancreatic enzyme, was duplicated, and in langur monkeys one of the copies mutated into RNASE1B, which works better in the more acidic small intestine of the langur. (Zhang et al. 2002) * Yeast was put in a medium with very little sugar. After 450 generations, hexose transport genes had duplicated several times, and some of the duplicated versions had mutated further. (Brown et al. 1998) The biological literature is full of additional examples. A PubMed search (at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi) on "gene duplication" gives more than 3000 references. 3) According to Shannon-Weaver information theory, random noise maximizes information. This is not just playing word games. The random variation that mutations add to populations is the variation on which selection acts. Mutation alone will not cause adaptive evolution, but by eliminating nonadaptive variation, natural selection communicates information about the environment to the organism so that the organism becomes better adapted to it. Natural selection is the process by which information about the environment is transferred to an organism's genome and thus to the organism (Adami et al. 2000). 4) The process of mutation and selection is observed to increase information and complexity in simulations (Adami et al. 2000, Schneider 2000).

3804;evolution;"In my opinion the whole debate seems rather idiotic. Let's assume that evolution is true in the belief that it all started with "The Big Bang." Essentially this means that there was a tiny, highly dense ball that exploded and started this awesome chain reaction. Let's stop right there and just debate that much. Forget genetic evolution, fossil findings ect. The debate never needs to go that far. I assume that we can all agree according to any scientific view everything has a lifespan, ie a beggining and an end. Such as protons, nutrons, all physical things and the universe. Do we all agree on this? ok, now I think we can all agree that according to even the most basic science nothing+nothing=nothing Ok so what's the point right? Well since everything has a to come from something and has to have a beginning, this super tiny, dense ball could not have just been floating in space for all eternity because we agreed that's not possible, and this ball could not have just came into existence from nothing, because that too is impossible. So even if you just take the theory a far as the tiny, dense ball of matter there is no possible way to get around the fact that something that stands outside of space/time, something eternal, ie GOD, had to have created it. You say "But that's not scientific and takes a leap of faith" and I will tell you that all other answers go against all scientific data at the most basic level on up and take a much bigger leap of faith to believe since I just proved they are all scientificaly impossible.";7;1;2;Evolution
600;evolution;"Everyone is like, "Evolution doesn't explain how we all began!!!". It's not supposed to, that is not the purpose of the theory of evolution. Evolution, the word, by definition means "change over time". The theory of evolution has nothing to do with the big bang, or how everything started in the galaxy, evolution is just really a simple concept. It's the concept of how natural organism change over time on earth, not how they got here, or began. I mean, I know a lot about evolution, and that's the main argument, people just don't understand that evolution isn't an answer to the beginning. Also, evolution is a scientific theory. A scientific theory is one that has been backed up my year and years, and thousands upon thousands of scientific information that only leads in one direction. For instance, gravity. Gravity is only a theory, we have proof that it currently exists, do we know why it exists? No exactly, but we have a pretty close answer, but it is only a theory because it could one day change. Just like evolution, we have information that only point towards it, not against it, but it could change one day, and we don't know that. There is a difference between a fact and a theory, 2+2=4, that's a fact, that will never change. gravity and evolution is a theory, it could very well one day change. People who believe in evolution are not trying to shut down people who believe in creationism, evolution is just a scientific statement of change over time. that's all.";7;1;2;Evolution
600;evolution;"Actually, it is proven that dinosaurs and birds, two completely different species are related and have changed through adaptation. Keep in mind, this isn't an over night change, it takes milions upon milions upon millions of year to occur. Think about bats. Bats are mammals. They have fur, they birth like any other mammals, no eggs involved. We are very much genetically related to bats, yet they fly like birds? Why? adaptation to environemental change, something that takes a LONG time to occur, but occurs none the less. Now dinosaurs, they are reptiles, how could they become birds? It's called homologous structures. Through bone sturctures, organs, muscles, and other important factors, organisms can be related to each other through common anscestory. For example, why do birds have wings?And why do we have arms? how do birds have legs? how do we have legs? How do birds have heads? how do we have heads? birds have eyes, we have eyes. Why do we share so much in common with so many organisms? The only explanation is the derivation of a common anscetor milllions of years ago that head a head, had arms or wings, had legs, had eyes. The structure of the bones within a bird, whale, human, are almost completely similar structures as far as the compostition on the bone is concerned. And then, we have to keep in mind of etymological relations. If you look at a human fetus, whale fetus, bird fetus in the first few months and weeks of like, there is almost no difference in structure or the way they look, theya ctually look almost the same. I implore you to look at this. Why? Coincidence? I'm afraid not, the beauty of change over time!";7;1;2;Evolution
600;evolution;"We cannot say that micro-evolution occurs but that macro-evolution does not. It is false to say that the changes that occur at the microscopic level in our bodies or in the bodies of any organism does not have a lasting effect at the macroscopic level. Take DNA. Good ol' Deoxyribosenucleic acid. Now, DNA is constantly going through mutations. 1 in every 10,000 base pairs in the DNA strand of a homo-sapian is mutated, whether that part of the strand is deleted, inserted, flipped, it happens. Okay, when we reproduce, chromosomes (build-ups/thick clumps of DNA and tertiary protein bonds) are mixed between the male and female. It's called Meiosis. So say, the mother's DNA codes for long hair, and the fathers DNA strand genetically codes for curly hair. When their chromosomes go through meiosis, and the alleles cross-over onto each others, the base pairs mix together. That's why if a mother with straight hair, and a father with curly have a kid, the kid has wavy hair. that is an example of how DNA changes at the microscopic level and have a macroscopic effect. This kid with wavy hair will then pass down his genetic material and mix it with someone else, and it will go on and on, and the pool of gentic codes will constantly be changed and over millions of years, that generation will have been completely changed.

Anything new that we can't explain gets chalked up to, "Well, that's just part of the ID we'll never be able to understand." It closes the question. If, on the other hand, a new fact seems to contradict evolution, science has to go to work. Explain it, refute it, incorporate it, or throw out evolution entirely because of it: the theory must adapt to the facts. That's what makes it science. It's comforting to have catchalls, psychology has a lot of them. Someone starts sleeping 18 hours a day, you can just call them depressed, a kid's getting lousy grades you can call it ADD. Except that we know that those are diagnoses of last resort, and so first you have to do the work. You run medical tests, you investigate lifestyle factors, you check for inherited issues or environmental contributions. You check everything that can be disproved before you attach a label that can't be disproved, that's how science is supposed to function.

3868;evolution;"Intelligent design MUST not be taught. First, let us define our terms, A theory is "an explanation of concept/idea that is supported by evidence and/or many experiments/trials and is widely accepted by the scientific community." So yes, evolution is absolutely a theory, yet it is present to have some sort of negative connotation. Gravity is still a theory, as there is instances in time and spaces where its effects vary (such as in the case of dark matter.) This does not therefore imply that gravity does not exist consistently on the planet earth, merely that it's effects are, perhaps, not always consistent in every instance and therefore it is possible that it can never be a law. On the other hand, intelligent design is NOT a theory because it is not scientific. Whereas evolution is a conclusion based on a collection of observations, ID is a conclusion that uses observations to support it. This flies in the face of the scientific process. You are taking the word of the bible, in itself unscientific, and drawing a conclusion from it. From there you collect instances in nature that fit this conclusion and ignore those that do not. This is not scientific. This is not to say, however, that there is not God and that, assuming there is, He played no role in our creation. I find it entirely plausible that God started the chain of events that brought us to where we are today. I, however, do not believe he played any role whatsoever after the Big Bang, and evolution tells us that he did not. I have no disputes with your, or any other, God, merely with ID's hijacking of science for the purpose of projecting religion onto subjects where it does not belong. Such is the irrefutable, undeniable and inescapable reasoning as to why Intelligent Design does not and cannot belong in the scientific classroom, because it, by definition, is not science.

915;evolution;"No, because while ID uses some possibly legitimate scientific facts, the essence of the "theory" is anti-scientific. It is a thinly disguised attempt to insert the insidious force of theology into an arena in which it should never be allowed to intrude. Science is based on radical open-mindedness, combined with radical skepticism. It is clear to any intellectually honest person that ID has the very opposite characteristics. If there somehow were evidence of a creator God, uh, I mean, intelligent designer, then the scientific community would definitely accept it. Think of the original Darwinian, Charles Darwin himself. When faced with unambiguous evidence, he admitted that it called for an entirely new paradigm, despite the personal pain caused by the loss of his religious belief. The same would occur if scientists were to somehow see evidence for the opposing perspective. Religious thinking is inherently nihilistic, by which I mean that it embraces a cheap relativism, which says that all views are equally legitimate, regardless of what the evidence says. These nihilists do not believe in the human mind or in evidence from our five senses. It believes that humanity and the human world is marked only by folly and ignorance. To illustrate my point, and the degree to which ID theorists are distrustful of the very basis of science, you should watch the ID debate on Youtube (the one with William F. Buckley). Toward the end, David Berlinski makes a very telling statement, to the effect that everything is an illusion. I apologize for not having the specific quote, but if one watches the debate, they will certainly notice what I am talking about. Berlinski is a scientist, who is fully aware of the ability of the human mind to comprehend the world around it, by the use of reason, that uniquely human faculty. Because of this nihilism, religious people believe that in this world of ignorance and folly, it is permissible to use any and every means to achieve one's goal. Because they do not see the deep honesty of science, instead considering it merely the current mantle of legitimacy, they see no problem with using the brilliantly cunning scheme of intelligent design to establish what they believe to be the truth, the only ray of light to enter into the darkness of the cave.";7;1;2;"ID should NOT be taught."
3868;evolution;"Utterly false. Evolution conforms to a rigid scientific process involving observing animals, especially their physical and biological traits and determining exactly what their linage was through time. Intelligent Design, although I do not discount its credibility *outside the scientific realm*, it is essentially supplementing a preconceived notion in lieu of an actual conclusion. I'm very curious to know about these 'experiments' and 'testable conclusions.' You would think that a scientific experiment proving the existence of God would be more publicized. The Bible has everything to do with the intelligent design movement. Saying otherwise is merely a tactic used by the (admittedly more progressive) ID believers who wish to remove themselves from fundamentalist Christians thumping on this concept. It is the basis of the conclusion that drives ID believers. I sincerely doubt you'll be looking into the Qu'ran. I have large doubts that the Bible just happens to coincide with what you believe. The similarities with the arguments for ID and the writings in Gensis are just a huge coincidence? My arguments are not anti-God, anti-theist or anti-Christian. I am merely saying that all modern science strongly suggests that the only celestial being that had a impact on the earth was an asteroid.

Furthermore, scientists often discover several fossils from the same animal, therefore are able to fill in the blanks. You treat these scientists like they're a bunch of fourth graders diggin up rocks. These are highly trained paleontologists who dedicated their lives to knowing what they're talking about. For you to sit there and say that fossils don't prove anything because they're not evidence is obvious disingenuous and fundamentally void of facts or logic. Say you have twenty fossils from what is obviously the same animal, each one can be carbon dated to be 100,000 years away from the previous and each one contains one or more small change from the previous.

My intention was to do an understanding of science series, but I haven't got around to this, and in the meantime I've felt obliged to respond at length to some other videos. But that's not particularly relevant. The "no time before the big bang" position is not philosophical. It is a matter of mathematics. The big bang is in essence a mathematical theory which is well-supported by the evidence. One of its consequences is that time, as we understand it, loses its meaning prior to the big bang. The analogy is inaccurate, but if it makes you feel comfortable imagine that time is infinte, but compressed to such a degree during the big bang that it has a measurable beginning, *measured at the rate that we currently experience it*. So the question, "what happened before the big bang?" is meaningless on more than one level. (a) we have no way of knowing, (b) the mathematics says that time itself didn't exist before the big bang, and (c) it's not clear that the question actually makes sense in the first place. There is no "poof" in the big bang. Roger Penrose's lecture on this is enlightening, it's on youtube, search for "roger penrose big bang". If anybody came up with a viable creation hypothesis, i.e. an argument that is falsifiable, supported by all the evidence we have and predictive so that future observations can look for something we wouldn't otherwise expect, then scientists might take it seriously. That is the standard of rigor for scientific hypotheses, imagine then how powerful a theory is to a scientist. Scientific theories are as close as we get to the truth.

So the argument should always be about whether the universe was created by a conscious being or a natural event. Unfortunately I always see too many references to God in debates such as this. The Bible was originally penned by human beings and was once considered a blasphemous text. People mocked Christianity in the same way we today mock Scientology. Personally I see no difference between the two in this respect, only that one has enjoyed the benefit of thousands of years and an increasingly powerful hub (the Catholic Church) to spread its message. So even if I were to be convinced away from my strong atheistic beliefs and accept the universe was created by a divine being, and not a natural event, I would still be very far away indeed from accepting Christianity as the true faith.

Suppose that something did exist that was "outside" the universe. Then either that entity interacts with the universe - in which case its presence could in theory be detected by some means - or else it does not, in which case it can have no impact on our lives within this universe. I'm happy with either position. Since we have been unable to detect any external interference in the universe, I tend to align myself with the "it doesn't interact" position. This is compatible with the view that God set the universe in motion, and then sat back to watch. It is also compatible - although far less likely to be so for reasons I will come to - with the idea that when we die, we arrive in front of the creator for judgement. I'm happy with that too. If God is good, then I believe he will accept my lifelong position of sticking to what I know and what can be deduced about the universe, and being skeptical about the rest. If he doesn't accept this, then in my view he is not a being worth worshiping in the first place. Judgement I consider unlikely, because it seems clear that what we are is solely a function of the matter that makes us up. The evidence for this comes from brain trauma victims - my cousin Grant is one of those unfortunates, and to a lesser extent so is my uncle Giles, who had a brain tumor. A slight alteration in the matter of our brains can lead to a drastic change in our personalities. It is difficult to reconcile this data with the idea of an eternal soul that somehow preserves our essence. "What lit the wick that was the creation of the universe?" It's not necessarily the case that anything lit the wick. As I explained in my video on time and the big bang, from a theoretical outside observer's point of view, which I referred to as a "superclock" (such a thing of course being impossible), the universe is in fact infinite in extent. It only has a measurable age because of the expansion of time from a singularity at the origin. So yes, I guess you're right to say that this has philosophical consequences that can be discussed, but one must first be sure that one's position is consistent with what the mathematics say, because the big bang theory is overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. What are the philosophical consequences? As I see it, they are that discussion of things that are before or outside the big bang is meaningless, because it is in principle untestable. I do not wish to suggest that I would not dearly like to know the answers to such questions, I would, just as I would dearly love to escape the confines of Einstein's relativity and travel to the edge of the universe. What I am suggesting is that such knowledge is apparently impossible, not to say meaningless in the sense that the question "what is the colour of a circle?" is meaningless. That should not and will not stop me and other scientist from doing our best to poke holes in our current understanding. Not only is that part of the scientific process, but we also have good motivation to do so, because much of what science currently has to say about the universe is, quite honestly, downright depressing. But the facts, hard though they are, must be accepted. Does that make my point of view clear?";7;0;2;Naturalism
1189;evolution;"You didn't exactly prove or give evidence to anything in our latest and finished debate. Why are you still clingy to these same creationist fallacies that don't seem to compel anyone rational?";7;0;2;Naturalism
337;evolution;"PS - technical addendum to what I said before. There is a school of thought that says that our universe is the result of the explosion of a black hole in another universe. We would not initially be causally connected with the other universe, but over time the light-cones would intersect. This has the striking implication that the rate of expansion might increase after a time, as the universes become causally connected and matter outside our universe starts to pull our space-time apart. And indeed there is some evidence that the rate of expansion is increasing. However, this idea presents several other sticky problems. For one thing, we don't know whether it is possible for a black hole to explode, although the big bang itself seems to suggest that this can happen (it was a singularity just like any other black hole, after all). It may be that after a time we will observe daughter-universes expanding within our own universe. The jury is out on this one. But it's an extremely interesting idea, although also terrifying in the sense that if it is correct, then we are even more insignificant than we previously thought. It is difficult to imagine, given the size of the universe, that we are any more than a fleeting concern to a supposed creator.";7;0;2;Naturalism
337;evolution;"Oh boy. Another one. Look up the Larus gull, or JFGI: observed instances of speciation. And don't be idiotic and insist that there should be a crocoduck. Look at the Wikipedia article on Hominidae. Our species diverged from the chimps (Pan genus) around 5 million years ago. More recently the ancestral line forked into H. sapiens and H. neandertalensis. Our line survived, theirs did not. Do some reading, and then come back. www.talkorigins.org is a good place to start. As for the origin of the universe: If this alleged creator doesn't have to have a beginning/creator, then why should the universe? The universe is far simpler than the creator would have to be. Besides which, we know from the big bang theory that the early universe would necessarily have been causally isolated from anything that was allegedly "outside" it. It is also, from a certain point of view, infinite in time. Time as we experience it was a product of the big bang just as space was.";7;0;2;Naturalism
4093;evolution;"How can you be so out of touch with your own existence? If you took time to crawl out from beneath your aged rock and observe what is around you - you would notice patterns and similarities all across the spectrum of the world and the species therein. I'll give you some examples to start you off... (respiratory, nervous, digestive, ocular ETC systems, two eyes, instincts, motherhood) To suggest that the world and the animals upon it are not intricately and integrally linked is simply absurd - do you understand what worms are actually doing to the soil? Do you think that migration of birds choreographed by The Lord? Did you know the actions of termites are imperative to the most basic level of our ECOSYSTEM? (If you know what that means, what the impications of such systems are etc). Why do all animals on earth have certain things in common if this is not the result of a process of change and diversification? Are there no keen religious gardeners, I often ask myself. I must admit, I am shocked by the immaturity and general lack of knowledge prevailant in the argument for creationism. You have riled me up darling.";7;0;2;Naturalism
337;evolution;"Gee whizz. I didn't think it was possible to fit so much misinformation into such a small space, but now I know. 1. It's called taxonomy. Clade divisions are based on a multitude of evidence, from fossils to molecular biology, geography and anatomy. And we know how old they are by, again, a multitude of methods: carbon dating, vulcanism, chemical analysis, geological analysis, and so on. 2. If God is "outside time" (whatever that means), then does this not imply that he is causally isolated from our universe? In which case, is it not true to say that he is and will always be irrelevant to our existence? 3. "...the universe has not reached equilibrium yet..." Wow. Big word, what do you think it means? This is just a plain nonsense, what sort of equilibrium is it that you think the universe hasn't reached? 4. The big bang was not a ball of dirt. That's just beyond ridiculous. Perhaps try reading Wikipedia first next time? Last I heard, it was the Bible told us we came from dirt... 5. Ditto, and how do you expect the "ball of dirt" to spin faster and faster? Where does the energy come from? 6. You're waving your hand vaguely at what is called conservation of angular momentum. The universe has no angular momentum, there being no frame of reference against which to define a moment. As for why Venus rotates "the wrong way" - how about looking it up? Turns out Venus is actually upside-down, most likely due to an earlier impact with a large interplanetary body. 7. No they don't. The theory in no way implies this. 8. Perhaps try coming up with your own, original arguments rather than copying drivel that was swept away a century ago?";7;0;2;Naturalism
337;evolution;"1a) There are thousands of intermediate forms. There's a bloody list on www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-intermediate.html. 1b) You obviously have no understanding of evolution. Humans and chimps have a common ancestor. One did not evolve from the other. Even a basic study of the biology will demonstrate how utterly wrong your idea of evolution is. 1c) See Ken Miller talking about the bacterial flagellum on Youtube. This was one of the most important reasons why ID was adjudged unscientific in Kitzmiller v. Dover. Miller demolished the "irreducible complexity" argument. And you get to watch him doing it. 1d) Same old "carbon dating doesn't work" trope. Get with the century. It works extremely well within certain parameters. Outside of those parameters, you get garbage. That's why we cross-check with other methods. The ages of the fossils are known to a scientific certainty. 2. I'm a mathematician, and I CAN prove that anything that was "outside" the big bang cannot be causally connected with it. In English, that means either God is inside the universe and therefore subject to its timescale, or else he cannot interact with it. Proof trumps opinion. 3. What you're trying to suggest is that the universe should become isotropic over a long time-scale. There are at least three problems with your argument: (a) gravity doesn't permit this to happen, (b) on an interior timescale, the universe is not infinitely old, it's 13.7bn years old - the infinite age is what you get if you're on the outside looking in, (c) there's no known physics that indicates that the universe should converge to isotropy. Science fail. 4. I suggest you change schools. The big bang was not a "gathering of matter" - to the best of our knowledge, it STARTED in a singular state. The best approximation to this is a black hole. It then EXPANDED outwards, cooling and condensing as it did so. In case you're interested, the early matter of the universe was mostly hydrogen, apparently with a bit of helium mixed in. Pretty far from dirt. 5. Since the universe has no angular momentum, that's not a question I have to answer. It did not "spin faster and faster", because it did not spin. The energy problem only arises in your peculiar interpretation. 6. Have you actually done any reading at all on this subject? Because if you had, you would know that Venus completely rebuilds its surface every few hundred thousand years or so. Hence it's one of the least-cratered planets in the solar system. An asteriod of sufficient mass to change its axis of rotation wouldn't have to be planet-killingly large. Particularly since it would have to strike the planet at an angle. As for why it's round - it's round for the same reason all the other planets are round. That's the lowest-energy configuration of the matter. The relatively slow rate of rotation also supports the impact theory, because angular momentum would have bled off as the gyroscopic effect reasserted its axis of rotation. 7. The arguments you "came up with" are well-known tropes of the creationist movement, all of which have been dismissed decades ago. So I hardly have to work to provide the rebuttals.";7;0;2;Naturalism
337;evolution;"And your faith blinds you. 1. Ken Miller - what he demonstrated is that each piece of the flagellum by itself is adaptive. What makes you think the bacterium would die if it didn't have it? It would simply be less efficient at reproducing. The same applies to the eye - 5% of an eye is a hell of a lot better than no eye at all. There wouldn't be a flagellum until all the parts started to cooperate, true, but there is still advantage in having the separate parts by themselves. That's what Miller was saying. 2. Don't try to lecture me on carbon dating. I know how radioactive decay works. Radioactive carbon is not formed naturally on the earth's surface. It requires high-energy radiation which is only available in the upper atmosphere. Therefore once it is embedded in rock, the amount of carbon 14 is fixed, and since it decays at a known rate, we can measure the difference between the number of radioactive isotopes and the number of non-radioactive isotopes to find out what the original composition was and how long it's been decaying. Carbon dating works. See http://www.acad.carleton.edu/curricular/BIOL/classes/bio302/Pages/CarbonDatingBack.htm. Besides which, we always cross-check with other dating methods. 3. Nobody knows how the singularity that was the initial universe got there. Don't pretend that you do, and I won't pretend that I do. We know it was there, and that's all. Postulating a god does not provide any additional information, and is not a testable hypothesis. It's not an explanation at all, and in fact it raises more questions than it answers. 4. Nobody is in charge of the universe. And that 2% estimate of yours is way off, several orders of magnitude larger than most scientists would put it. If there was a 2% probability of life arising, then the galaxy would be a crowded place, because there are billions of planets available to nurture life. 5. "We can't know because nobody was there". Don't be silly. If that were true, then I could turn it around and say you can't know the universe was created because nobody was there. We know Venus rebuilds its surface because there is evidence to support that hypothesis. Apart from the lack of craters, there is evidence of periodic extreme vulcanism which would remelt the surface, wiping out any impact craters. Venus is geologically active, despite not having a plate tectonic system that we can discern. This is an interesting subject, and there's a lot of literature out there. Read it. 6. That's a cheek. You haven't given a single hypothesis that is testable. I, on the other hand, have studied this material. So when I ask "how do they know?" it's a question I can answer. How do you know God exists? What's your evidence? If you haven't studied a subject and you aren't able to answer the "how do they know?" question, then you have two options: study or shut up.";7;0;2;Naturalism

Alright, let's see it. You guys have so much science to back up your claims that religious affiliation amongst scientists is a tiny minority. Those scientists that are religious, Christians included, almost all agree with the Theory of Evolution. Francis Collins, former head of the Human Genome Project and a practicing Christian, is one of those people. "For example, suppose that we did get a dog or cat out of the 'former species'. How exactly did each dog or cat develop into its own species instead of moving on to that of another creature? Why don't we just have one species of each?" Rob, why don't you read books by the scientists, the Christian ones as well, and learn something about evolution? Your questions don't even make sense. We have literally watched new breeds of dogs and cats come into existence through artificial selection. It is one of the most glaring proofs that evolution occurs. You wouldn't see new species of cats or dogs evolve because you are not breeding TWO DIFFERENT SPECIES! When you do breed two different species that are capable of interbreeding YOU GET A NEW SPECIES! Have you ever heard OF A MULE or A LIGER?! Natural selection creates species over vast expanses of time so there is no reason to think that we should just see new species popping up left and right through natural selection. Do you actually care whether or not evolutionary theory is valid or not or do you just want to cling, like a fundamentalist, to your irrational religious beliefs? Do you just want to claim that you, who is completely ignorant of even the most basic knowledge on evolution, know more than the scientists? The Christian ones as well?! Also, I wanted to bring up this point. Our structural imperfection is a strong proof of evolution, but if your God created us he must like watching people suffer. Take our imperfectly evolved eyes. Why is it that the jelly that fills up the eye liquefies as we age, occasionally causing the retina to tear? Then the liquid can seep into the layer underneath the retina causing retinal detachment. Is this the handy work of your God? Is arthritis and tooth decay, which caused the suffering and death of many of our early ancestors, and every other ill that mankind and animals suffer from the divine creation of your God?!

"Christianity starts out with a major advantage - a Textbook explicitly explaining how humanity came into being." You are delusional. "How can you so blatantly ignore such a major part of the Bible (unless you are picking and choosing what you want to believe)" Huh, that's funny. The irony is killing me on this one. Just like you ignore the biblical mandate to rest on the Sabbath? Just like you ignore the biblical mandate to kill those who don't believe as you do? Yes, there is a biblical mandate for that: If you hear that in one of the towns that Yahweh your God has given you for a home, there are men, scoundrels of your own stock, who have led their fellow citizens astray, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," hitherto unknown to you, it is your duty to look into the matter, examine it, and inquire most carefully. If it is proved and confirmed that such a hateful thing has taken place among you, you must put the inhabitants of that town to the sword, you must lay it under the curse of destruction - the town and everything in it. You must pile up all its loot in the public square and burn the town and all its loot, offering it all to Yahweh your God. It is to be a ruin for all time and never rebuilt. (Deuteronomy 13:12-16) You don't have to take those parts of the bible literally but Collins should take the creation story literally? "Yes, but supposing that the cat evolved from the dog again, okay?" If you would read and learn about Evolution you wouldn't ask such idiotic questions. Go look up transitional forms and speciation. "The human body has its flaws and capabilities. Yet, it's far better than that of any man made creation." "Many diseases, weaknesses and flaws are actually the result of human actions." LOL.

No scientist claims this. Evolution works through natural selection which is the exact opposite of chance. Richard Dawkins clarifies this point in his book, "The blind watchmaker". Think of a monkey typing on a computer. This would be you're idea of how evolution works. Now think of a monkey typing on a computer with spell check turned on. This is more or less how evolution really works. The complexity of living systems could never evolve by chance�they had to be designed and created. Back again.. Now according to your logic, the complexity of life on earth could never have evolved by chance, and had to be created or designed. So God, something far more complex does not need to be created or designed? Do you realize that we have documented studies of fish such as the "stickleback" which has adapted to new environments in the past few decades, and evolved into their own species? We've done thousands of studies on flies to show just how easily the evolve. And viruses evolve at an incredible rate. Ever wonder why they keep changing the flu shot? Its because influenza evolves! Oh but it couldn't be evolution it must be God who is tweaking its DNA. God has to keep improving his weapons on the human race, because we all know Christians never get influenza, only the sinners.

2;evolution;"I have never read a high school biology text book with a chapter devoted entirely to slamming religion.The reason for this is that scientists justify their findings on their own merit. They have no need to slam other areas like creationism. Creationism does not provide evidence to support itself so it needs to slam science in order to justify itself. Evolution has not been cast out by scientists. Maybe it doesn't look the same as when Darwin proposed it, but that's because scientists are interested in progress and improving theories. Additionally, there is proof of evolution in the form of speciation (there is other assorted proof, but I'm not a biologist so I won't try to explain it). For instance, a new mosquito has developed that is specifically adapted to live in London metro tunnels. This insect did not previously exist (which makes sense as there were no metro tubes, before metro tubes were built). Claiming that evolution should not be taught as it inflicts harm on and is unfair to religion is a weak argument. Evolution is not a belief system. Most developed nations are founded with freedom of religion in mind. In this vein, people are therefore guaranteed freedom to pursue no religion. Teaching creationism is akin to teaching religion. If it is taught in public schools, the children's right to freedom of religion is being violated. Furthermore, Pope John Paul II himself is quoted as saying "In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than a hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies – which was neither planned nor sought – constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory."

1189;evolution;""I thought to myself, If evolution is so solid, why do they continue to publish false and disproven findings in our textbooks?" Evolutionary theory is not founded on Haeckel's observations or theories. Haeckel's work was discredited in the 19th century, and has not been relevant to biology since the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of genetics. That the biogenetic law is false has been the consensus of biologists for over 100 years, and developmental biologists have been working constructively to provide alternative explanations, which have so far all been evolutionary in nature. The similarities between vertebrate embryos are real. We must distinguish between observations of those similarities and hypotheses about their causes. The similarities are not in doubt, there are worthwhile studies of the degree and timing of the similarities, but none that question their overall existence. What Wells has described is one hypothesis about the cause, Haeckel's biogenetic law, which failed early and spectacularly. He has not addressed any modern hypotheses, nor has he provided a better alternative. Evidence for common descent lies in the unity of form and process. We do not use Haeckel's outmoded, invalid mechanism to argue for evolution. Instead, we look at the marvelous convergence of disparate organisms on common principles: all animals use the same genes to define regions of their bodies, all vertebrates build their faces by unlikely rearrangements of odd pharyngeal protrusions, and even tailless mammals like us have to start with tailed embryos. The best explanation for these phenomena is that they are a consequence of a common heritage. - PZ Myers Now, would you consider learning about evolution now, since you now know of this?

Nobody has ever said, "evolution is true because Darwin/Huxley/Gould/Dawkins says so". On the other hand, quite a few people have said that evolution can't be true because the Bible says so. I sure hope we do eventually colonize space, but nothing about evolution tells us that this will happen - if anything, the lesson is that even the mighty fall (cf. the dinosaurs). Radioactive (and other forms of) dating. We don't declare the dates to be correct. We compare the results of a number of different dating methods, see that they agree, and then take this as strong evidence that the dates are correct. Radiometric dating is only "notoriously inaccurate" in the minds of creationists. In reality it's accurate to within about 1% in most cases. As you would know if you bothered to look up radiometric dating in an encyclopedia. As to scientists "arbitrarily assigning dates" - that is a very serious charge. You're accusing them of lying and/or falsifying evidence. Back up your accusation, please. Same applies to paleomagnetic findings. The use of analogy is often used to instruct, but never as a basis for a scientific theory. Perhaps Herbert Spencer was a moron, but what does a 200-year-old philosopher have to do with evolution? Talk about using analogy to mislead.... And for God's sake, let go of Haeckel already. He was arguing for a completely separate theory, loosely described as "ontogenesis recapitulates phylogenesis". It wasn't evolutionary theory then, and it isn't evolutionary theory now. The commonly-used "survival of the fittest" shorthand for evolution is indeed tautological as it stands. That's not the definition of evolution. Evolution is the change in allele frequencies of a population due to differential rates of reproduction of the phenotypes corresponding to the set of genotypes in the pool. In no way is this definition tautological. "There was only sand, seawater, lightning, and volcanoes to produce evolution, so we know that is what produced it. " Statements like that make me cringe. To paraphrase Babbage, I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a statement. It's an infantile thing to say. And I guarantee you it wasn't a scientist who said it. So who's the creationist straw-man in this case? ...And you go on with another half a dozen equally infantile misconstructions of science, which are rightly easy to demolish, straw-men that they are. "Since creationism could not possibly be true, ours wins by default." Nonsense. Utter rubbish. The actual statement is this: to demonstrate that life must have had a creator, you must show that this is the only mechanism that could have achieved the given complexity. Since you have not demonstrated that it is the only possible mechanism (evolution being a viable alternative), and since your hypothesis makes no other testable predictions, you have not advanced an argument that makes a useful contribution to our understanding of the world. In other words, creationism is useless (as Rev. Marc Leclerc said to the Discovery Institute, in explanation for why they weren't invited to the Vatican's conference on evolution). Evolution can be falsified. It's been said many times. Find a fossil rabbit in the pre-Cambrian, and you've blown evolution out of the water. That's all you have to do. Maybe you should be out there digging instead of in here misquoting?

337;evolution;"Evolution by analogy: A living creature's genes are like a set of blueprints that are used to build the creature. Offspring inherit roughly half of their blueprints from each parent (with some exceptions). Very occasionally a blueprint is subtly altered when it is being copied. Some blueprints are "better" than others when it comes to surviving and reproducing, e.g. longer legs make it easier to run away from predators. Statistically, we expect that over time there will be more of the better blueprints and fewer of the inferior blueprints. Sometimes, particularly when two populations are isolated from each other, the sets of available blueprints in two populations become so different that they are incompatible, i.e. it's impossible to build a working individual from any combination of blueprints from the two sets. This is known as speciation. Once this happens, the blueprints tend to drift further apart, as no mixing occurs. Thus we end up with situations where, for example, the reptiles branched into two distinct groups, birds and mammals, which cannot breed with each other. Over further time the distinct groups branch into further incompatible sub-groups (e.g. canines and ungulates), and then branch again and again, so that we end up with a "tree of life" - many distinct species, all of which had a common ancestor at some point, but some pairs having had a more recent common ancestor than others. For example, humans and chimps had a common ancestor about 5 million years ago, whereas our most recent common ancestor with the baboons lived about 24 million years ago. How can it be that two populations might favor different blueprints? There are a variety of reasons for this. Consider, for example, one population living near water and another living near trees: the population near water will tend to favor blueprints that make it easier to swim, while the population near trees favors blueprints that help them to swing from the branches. This is the origin of divergent evolution. Species fit themselves into niches, and each niche imposes different requirements which lead to different genes being preferred. There's also convergent evolution: two species with very different origins may find themselves in similar situations, so that they both evolve towards a common adaption. An example of this is the Tasmanian wolf versus the common wolf: their origins couldn't be more different, but they both moved into the stalker-predator niche in their respective territories. Any questions? Sorry if anybody found this patronizing, but I hope it clarified evolution for some. It's also very hard to argue that this isn't what's happening, given what we know about DNA and population dynamics.";7;1;2;"for, evolution lessons in schools"

It is not about whether a god exists and created the earth and all life on it. It is about whether or not evolution is real. I stress that while I do not believe in a god myself, and do believe that evolution is a fact, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Even if you could prove god exists (which you can't) that would not count as proof that evolution does not. if we define evolution simply as the change in the gene pool over time, then there are many examples of evolution that we see before our very eyes. Dog breeders breed dogs for a specific reason, whether it is to look pretty, hunt animals, round up sheep, what have you. If a dog breeder wants a dog with a shorter snout, they will breed with dogs that already have shorter snouts, so that their new dog may have the genes that makes the snout shorter. This is change in the gene pool thus evolution, albeit via artificial selection.

My understanding of this debate is that one side would be for evolution (believe that evolution is a fact) and one would be against (believe that evolution does not exist). Is this also your understanding? You seem to freely admit that evolution does in fact occur, however your next statement is rather confusing. "All things are conjurations of perception". I think that by this you are suggesting there is no difference between thinking something is there, and that thing actually being there (at least to the person doing the thinking). Forgive me if I have misinterpreted, but I do not see what this (or really any of paragraph after the first two sentences) has to do with evolution. If I assume a direct connection, than I can only think you mean to say that evolution is there only because a number of people all gave the same perception of reality. To me this is much closer to certain religions than anything else. It could be argued that a lot of people only believe in religion because a lot of other people do. However I am not here to make that claim. You state that "Naturally that commonisms between correlating perceptions would help us refine the reality from the imagination". (I am going to assume that by commonism you mean something that is common, and not what the word actually means) Still, I do not agree with this statement. Reality is not, as you suggest, defined by common perceptions. This implies that whoever has the most people believing in the same thing is right. To continue this line of thought- this would mean if you got most people to believe that the earth is flat, than in reality, the earth would be flat. Why not instead look at facts? Are you really suggesting that science is null and void so long as the common perception differs from it? You go on to say that "we are unable to decipher whether others 'are', or just appear to be". I hope for your sake that you do not believe in this statement. This type of thought is extremely limiting. Furthermore it does nothing to dismiss evolution.

3616;evolution;"Yes there is a difference between majority rule and fact. I don't think anyone is trying to make that point, especially not me. You state that if someone were to ask me for actual evidence, I would only be "producing evidence for adaption within already existing species". While adaption is indeed evolution, (evolution is how animals adapt to environment) I will skip this because what I believe you are actually asking here is for the 'missing link', the point at which one species evolves into another. Unless of course you would like to go all the way back to single cell organisms? Back to the links: I assure you that not all these links are missing. Intermediates between animals do exist (in fossil form), in fact it could be said that any fossil is an intermediate between something and something else. This debate is about whether or not evolution occurs, correct? There is hard scientific proof that evolution does occur. You can't escape this. And if you really think you can, I would be very interested to know how. "Evolution is a philosophical imperative for a world that rejects the idea of having to answer to god. This is simply not true. As I believe I have already stated the two (the existence of god and the fact of evolution) do not have to be mutually exclusive. I admit that most religions do not allow for evolution to be true, but it is not specifically contradictory to believe in both god and evolution. "Actual evidence of natural processes always leads to the opposite of what 'should' be there". Please explain this statement. What do you mean by "what 'should' be there"? I am utterly perplexed by how you could explain this statement, or even think it in the first place. I disagree wholeheartedly with your closing sentence. Nothing could be further from the truth. There IS actual, scientific, physical evidence supporting evolution. Evolution is not true because it "MUST" be true. It is true because it IS true, it has actual, credible, scientific facts to back it up. Creationists seem to repeat to themselves that there is not any evidence, they do not actually research in to it, they just chant that mantra. I would like to direct you toward an interview between Richard Dawkins and Wendy Wright. Unfortunately I can only find it in video. I urge you to google it, it is on YouTube currently but may not stay. Otherwise there is a transcript of it in Richard Dawkins new book "The Greatest Show on Earth" which I also urge you to read, at least then maybe you can try to debunk facts that you have heard of yourself. Instead of just chanting that same mantra. If you can not find this, then at least you can learn about the various species of Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo sapiens. Go to any major museum and you will see at least replicas of these intermediates. These are just hominid examples. There are also examples on any vertebrate group you care to name.

3616;evolution;"Brendon594, you mistake what the theory really is. You seem to think that theory and fact are mutually exclusive, like some hierarchy of confidence. Darwin's theory of evolution is indeed a theory, however evolution itself is a fact. I'm sorry if this confuses you a little, please let me explain with an apt analogy. Gravity is a fact yes? You can not deny that things which are dropped fall. Einstein's explanation of gravity however, is only a theory- one which has been replaced this century with Newton's theory of gravity, and may be replaced soon with the promising work of Erik Verlinde and his Entropy Force theory (here is a link to an article on this new theory for your convenience http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527443.800-the-entropy-force-a-new-direction-for-gravity.html ). I hope this clears things up- while Darwin's proposed theory of evolution (mainly involving the mechanisms with which evolution works) is only a theory, evolution itself is fact. Edit: I saw one of your other posts- the one saying that you don't believe animals could come from a single cell organism. I like this quote from John Burdon Sanderson Haldane (a geneticist and evolutionary biologist) "..you did it yourself. And it only took you nine months".";7;1;2;Evolution

To reiterate- what is often referred to as the theory of evolution is actually the theories of the mechanisms of evolution (how evolution works, not whether it does). I have cited a few (of the many) fossils as evidence but I should explain that the fossil evidence, while very strong, is not the strongest evidence for evolution. Even if no fossils were found, evolution is still proved with DNA, molecular science, etc. I chose fossils because they are usually the easiest for people to understand and you can go see the physical evidence for yourself. There is no evidence against evolution that I am aware of (and please, if anyone has any come forward, I have done my own research but I can not find any).

3616;evolution;"I agree, there are many definitions for evolution. I believe I did earlier state what I take the definition of evolution to be but I will state here again as clearly as I can. "In biology, evolution is change in the genetic material of a population of organisms through successive generations." The key thing about these different types of evidence for evolution is how they complement each other. All these astoundingly different ways of proving evolution (which would all singularly prove evolution) interlock so perfectly, not one single peice contradicts any other. It is amazing! Take fossils for example.. how do creationists explain that not one single fossil is found in the wrong time period (the time period can be seen by, among other things, what type of rock and how far down the fossil is embedded). Out of the hundreds of thousands of different types of fossils found, none occur at the wrong time- all support evolution. How do creationists explain this? How would you? If all animals were created in the same week, than surely there would be all sorts of fossils in different time periods. I repeat- not one single fossil out of the millions found (hundreds of thousands of different types) not one is in a time period that does not complement evoltion. Intelligent design theorists seem to be almost based solely around what you have just pointed out. They also suggest that biological organs are so complicated, how could they possible have evolved. And so I ask you, if they are so complicated how could they have been designed? Presumably the designer would have to be even more complicated. And who designed the deisgner and so on and so forth- an obvious and infinte loop. But back to the one technique you singled out: DNA. DNA is invariable across creatures but the individual genes vary. This helps to prove that all creatures came from a single ancestor. When you look at the DNA from all animals ou will find a beautiful hierarchy.. human DNA is close to chimpanees, slightly more distant from monkeys, slighlty more distant still from rat, etc. And all this fits perfectly with what evolution already suggests with other evidence. I suggest you watch the interview between Richard Dawkins and Wendy Wright you can find on YouTube. It is truely fascinating how creationists simply choose to ignore evidence, even when they could reach out and touch it.";7;1;2;Evolution

I assume you are actually refering to radioactive dating (carbon is not the only radioisotope used in this manner) Let me lay out the approximations of half lifes for you: (I assume you have an inkling of how carbon dating works, given your dismisal of it) Uranium 235 to Lead 207 (half-life = 710,000,000 years) Uranium 238 to Lead 206 (half-life = 4,500,000,000 years) Thorium 232 to Lead 208 (half-life = 14,000,000,000 years) Rubidium 87 to Strontium 87 (half-life = 47,000,000,000 years) Potassium 40 to Argon 40 (half-life = 1,300,000,000 years) Carbon 14 to Nitrogen 14 (half-life = 5,570 years) .. with a margin of error of 1%, how can you get 6000 years out of the 4.5 billion estimated? there is no proof to this young Earth. None. while you mentioned that you believe carbon dating to be false you didn't actually mention how you would explain why fossils are only found in particular time periods. Now let's say you are correct in saying credible science has the time period wrong. This still does not explain why the fossils are all grouped together in certain types of rock.. if all animals were created around the same time (and especially i you're of the belief that adam's sinning brought death into the world) why do the fossils contain specific groups at specific times? regardless of if the time is millions of years ago or just a few thousand. Please note there are numerous other methods that show the earth to be older than 6000 years. Now what do you mean intelligent designer? It is easy when you look at the outside of an animal to say the design is intelligent.. but how about the inside? An intelligent designer (really any designer who has the ability of foresight, but pressing on) would surely make animals in the most efficent and logical way yes? Unfortunately for intelligent design believers this is not what we see. What we see instead lines up with evolution. Let's look at the sinus passages in a human. where would you expect the drainage hole to be.. given you are intelligent (perhaps even omnipotent.. though that is arguably an inherintly contradictory word) and have foresight? (I keep bringing up foresight because this is something important that evolution does not have) You would use gravity to help out surely. The human's sinus drainage passage is on top, facing up. This gives away our ancestoral past. On four legs, this passage would be positioned at the front.. when we stood up (eventually) the passage would be on top as we see now. There are many examples of unintelligent design, I will give one more for arguments sake. The koala. The koala's pouch faces down. What! Koalas spend most there time up trees! Who in their right (and intelligent) mind would design a tree climbing mammal with a pouch facing down?? But when you go through the koala's past you can see why.. not through ID but through evolution. Koalas are decended from a wombat-like (the '-like' is very important) creature. These creatures dig alot, if they had a forward facing pouch they would be constantly shoveling dirt in to their pouch and their young. As the Koala evolved it's pouch stayed the way of its ancestor. Intriguing to say the least, and not the most provoking of examples. If time, space and matter didn't exist.. than how did god? How can he exist outside these things.. there is no such thing as existance outside these things. If he doesn't exist in space/time than in what way does he exist. The interveiw is lengthy and can get repetitive given that Wright consistently avoids facts and question during the interview. But i do recommend you watch it. There are some fascinating facts that I think you would find truly interesting, regardless of your stance on religion. One last statement for yet another large post: evolution does not mean atheism.

There is no evidence that a God exists or that he did create or even could create anything.

"There is little or no evidence of erosion between the layers in rock" Firstly I would like to say that I have not looked much in to this but I do know that there is some evidence of erosion between layers of rock viewable in the Grand Canyon Related maybe indirectly to your argument: "‘The presence of each unconformity is physical evidence that the Colorado Plateau (the area taking in the Grand Canyon) experienced consolidation of sediments, uplift, and possibly gentle tilting, weathering of the uplifted surface to form soil, and erosion by streams and wind before the sediments of the next formation (rock layer) were deposited. There must have been several of these episodes of consolidation, uplift, weathering, and erosion—a conclusion clearly at variance with the theory that the sediments were deposited during a year-long global flood." - Dr. Davis Young, Professor of Geology at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan, a Christian geologist. I have not heard this sodium argument before so for now I will say nothing on it, I am looking forward to finding out what science has to say about it :-) Now to your statement about Koalas. Here (and in your next paragraph) I think we have reached what I believe to be the major pitfall of religion in general. The question is not why shouldn't it be upside down. The question is why is it? Why would a creator do that? Not why shouldn't he, but why did he. There are plenty of examples of unintelligent design, which are illogical and perhaps unexplainable for a creator, but logical and perfectly explainable for evolution. I guess you are right when you say I have never been outside of time, space and matter. But here is where the creationist rationale so interests and baffles me, "God is a Spirit. (No space, no matter) He has always existed. (No time) Just because nothing you have seen exists outside of time, space and matter doesn't mean there can't be something." God is a Spirit - How can you know this? What is a spirit? Where is your evidence of this? He has always existed - How can you know this? Where is your evidence? Just because nothing you have seen exists outside of time, space and matter doesn't mean there can't be something - Just because you haven't seen a dragon/fairy/unicorn/flying teapot doesn't mean there isn't one.

It is very important which parts are similar, and without knowing this, these statistics (and all like it) are useless. Of course we share some DNA code with everything, because there are genetic traits that are almost universally common. Such as respiration, transcription, translation, signaling cascades, transcriptional regulation, protein degradation. And might I add that this is consistent with evolution.

You are taking this way out of context (and you can not expect to understand evolution if you take facts out of context) unless I missed your point entirely. The common ancestor between a human and a chimpanzee did not actually have* (stressing this word for later misquotes) to look like either. Just because something looks similar does not mean that it is- I repeat: morphology, or physical appearance, does not correspond to genetic similarities (ie we can be genetically more similar to things that we are physically more different from).

I believe he is worthy of praise and I agree with a lot of the morals he pushed forth. I do not believe he was the son of God nor God himself nor a messenger of God (not sure what you believe so I tried to cover all bases). As for the flood.

There are so many things wrong with a year long global flood (where did all this water come from/go?) from which all animals (geological locations weren't a problem?) escaped by somehow boarding a massive ark (450 odd feet? Longer than any wooden ship on modern seas, and that's with iron reinforcement and constant pumping of water) where all the animals managed to survive with each other and repopulate the world.

3616;evolution;""in it's [the Bible's) consistency". The Bible? Consistent? One would expect the Bible to be consistent given that the four Gospels and Acts within were all supposedly the word of God. Unfortunately they are not consistent. 2 Samuel 8:4 states that King David captured 1700 horsemen, and 1 Chron. 18:4 claims he captured 7,000. If God was the author, the scribe, if both are Gods words than why are they different? Why can't he tell the same story twice? How about the numbers in clans and tribes in Ezra 2:3 and Neh. 7:8 Ezra: Arah: 775 Pahath Moab: 2812 Zattu: 945 Bebai: 623 Azgad: 1222 Adonikam: 666 Bigvai: 2056 Adin: 454 etc., etc. Nehamiah: Arah: 652 Pahath Moab: 2818 Zattu: 845 Bebai: 628 Azgad: 2322 Adonikam: 667 Bigvai: 2067 Adin: 655 etc., etc. There are some clear and large differences here. Again I ask- if God is the author of both lists than why are they different? Surely they can't both be right. 2 Kings 2:11 "...and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." Luke 24:51"...and [Jesus] was taken up into heaven." John 3:13 "And no man hath ascended up into heaven, except the one who came from heaven." So was it Jesus or Elijah? It can't be both given John says "one". Clearly at least one of these statements is incorrect. But which one and why, if they are all God's word. Ecclesiastes 1:4 "...the earth abideth forever" 2 Peter 3:10 "the elements shall melt with a fervent heat, the earth also, and works that are therein shall be burned up." Inconsistent. Genesis 32:30 "Jacob said, 'I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.'" John 1:18 "No man hath seen God at any time." Inconsistent. On that first Easter Sunday: "When the sun was coming up (Matt. 28:1) while it was still dark (John 20:1), Mary Magdalene (John 20:1) or Mary Magdalene and the other Mary (Matt 28:1) or "the women" [note the plural] (Luke 24:1) went to the tomb. There was an earthquake, and an angel came down and rolled the stone away (Matt. 28:2) from the entrance of the tomb and sat on it, even though it had apparently already been rolled away when Mary Magdalene had got there (John 20:1, Mark 16:4, Luke 24:2). The reason for the visit was to anoint the body with spices (Mark 16:1, Luke 24:1) or just to look at the tomb (Matt. 28:1)" just an example of the 'Crucifixion and Resurrection Mess' if you would like to take a look at that and more inconsistencies here: http://www.bidstrup.com/bible2.htm Have you read the Bible? why do you not see these things as inconsistencies?";7;1;2;Evolution

3616;evolution;"Sorry bookworm, I should have clarified. The quote is meant to be a joke, Douglas Adams wrote Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - which that quote is taken from. The contradiction that you pointed out is pretty much the basis of the joke. The Babel fish is a fictitious fish that you insert in to your ear and it translates languages. If you read further in to that quote though I think a logical deduction may be that there is no evidence, otherwise it wouldn't be called faith. Faith being the belief in something without evidence. (I guess the definition of faith here, however, could be argued) but all-in-all it was meant as a joke. I'm not going to argue where the water came from again, I could probably find things that disprove any physical theory you care to name, but even so you can just fall back on "God created it". Moot. "There was undoubtedly massive seismic movement during the Flood". Undoubtedly? Then why doesn't this catastrophe (the flood itself or the seismic movement) show up in tree ring dating? (tree ring records go back over 10,000 years). How about ice cores from Greenland? They have been dated back more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers. "A worldwide flood would be expected to leave a layer of sediments, noticeable changes in salinity and oxygen isotope ratios, fractures from buoyancy and thermal stresses, a hiatus in trapped air bubbles, and probably other evidence. Why doesn't such evidence show up?" As for your marine life: "Shells on mountains are easily explained by uplift of the land. Although this process is slow, it is observed happening today, and it accounts not only for the seashells on mountains but also for the other geological and paleontological features of those mountains. The sea once did cover the areas where the fossils are found, but they were not mountains at the time, they were shallow seas. A flood cannot explain the presence of marine shells on mountains for the following reasons: Floods erode mountains and deposit their sediments in valleys. In many cases, the fossils are in the same positions as they grow in life, not scattered as if they were redeposited by a flood. This was noted as early as the sixteenth century by Leonardo da Vinci (Gould 1998). Other evidence, such as fossilized tracks and burrows of marine organisms, show that the region was once under the sea. Seashells are not found in sediments that were not formerly covered by sea" There are just way too many problems to even mention so I hope you did look at that link. "wouldn't you expect the more intelligent animals to realize something was wrong and try to flee to high ground, thus being killed and buried later". To expect every animal to do this in a precise order borders on insane. But let's pretend that they did. So? They didn't die and then immediately become buried, they would be floating. Probably any sorting theory you can think up will be debunked here: http://www.noanswersingenesis.org.au/worldwideflood.htm This argument is a little disjointed because I find it utterly perplexing and struggle to see how anyone could think that every animal died in a precise order based on how well they could outrun the flood.";7;1;2;Evolution
1189;evolution;"Drop the specious misspelling of evolution. I present to you TalkOrigins: Evolution merely describes part of nature. The fact that that part of nature is important to many people does not make evolution a religion. Consider some attributes of religion and how evolution compares: 1) Religions explain ultimate reality. Evolution stops with the development of life (it does not even include the origins of life). 2) Religions describe the place and role of humans within ultimate reality. Evolution describes only our biological background relative to present and recent human environments. 3) Religions almost always include reverence for and/or belief in a supernatural power or powers. Evolution does not. 4) Religions have a social structure built around their beliefs. Although science as a whole has a social structure, no such structure is particular to evolutionary biologists, and one does not have to participate in that structure to be a scientist. 5) Religions impose moral prescriptions on their members. Evolution does not. Evolution has been used (and misused) as a basis for morals and values by some people, such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and E. O. Wilson (Ruse 2000), but their view, although based on evolution, is not the science of evolution, it goes beyond that. 6) Religions include rituals and sacraments. With the possible exception of college graduation ceremonies, there is nothing comparable in evolutionary studies. 7) Religious ideas are highly static, they change primarily by splitting off new religions. Ideas in evolutionary biology change rapidly as new evidence is found. Evolution may be considered a religion under the metaphorical definition of something pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. This, however, could also apply to stamp collecting, watering plants, or practically any other activity. Calling evolution a religion makes religion effectively meaningless. Evolution as religion has been rejected by the courts: B Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause. /B The court cases Epperson v. Arkansas, Willoughby v. Stever, and Wright v. Houston Indep. School Dist. are cited as precedent (McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education 1982). *McLean v.

The origin of life is a separate question, and one which is covered by the theory of naturalistic abiogenesis, which is a theory arising from a different scientific discipline, namely organic chemistry. - Calilasseia This is rather telling that you simply aren't interested in scientific theories that are testable and demonstrable, which creationism is NOT.";7;1;2;Yes

Creationism, on the other hand, has no basis in science.

So, while I support teaching evolution in school, I believe that a compromise would be the best solution. In every biology textbook, there is a unit on survival of the fittest and evolution. I think that during this unit, all the major explanations for the existence and variety of life on Earth should be presented to students in as unbiased a way as possible.

The Theory of Evolution has years of evidence and testing by countless scientists to back it while, while religion focusses on beliefs instead of facts. That is why Creationism is not a real theory. At best, it's a hypothesis, but a flimsy one at that. As for the whole "democracies where Christianity is illegal," I can honestly say I wouldn't support such a democracy if it existed.

You have to answer this in terms of logic, not in terms of something like "God is a creator, so he cannot be created, he can only create because he is the first cause, etc." This is not logic- this is all unfalsifiable.

I can just as easily say that life on earth exists because a ghost on Neptune magically did it, and we would not be able to disprove this.

No one in the world has yet to find any other than religious testimony, so it is safe to say that as of this point, there is no reason to believe in a designer. 4. "Intelligent design wins.

Based on observation of the world around us it is not unreasonable to conclude that some conscious mind (being) is responsible for the motion of the universe." I'm sorry? the cause of this movement is unknown? Actually the cause of wind is very known, it is due to the heating of the atmosphere, hot air rises, cold air takes its place. Wind moves things because it has mass, and kinetic energy. It is not reasonable to conclude that a conscious being makes this movement. (Please note that at some point in the past it very well may have been reasonable to assume it was the Greek Gods known as the Anemoi, in fact it may have been unreasonable to conclude that is was simple science. As science took hold those Gods became irrelevant, useless, and most importantly needless - we no longer need those Gods to explain things) "The only other option is that some unconscious thing is responsible for the motion of the universe. This, however, runs contrary to everything that we observe in the world around us." What about atoms? We observe them moving spontaneously. Brownian Motion? Gravity? Are you saying that everything in the world around us has a conscious thing responsible for its motion? There are plenty of observations of the world around us that do not need a conscious mind. "However, the Necessary Being must be conscious, because some of the beings that emanate from it are conscious. This is not unreasonable, we have never observed an unconscious being produce a conscious being." Nor have we observed a conscious being create a universe, (or anything out of nothing) yet this is reasonable to conclude? It seems more conceivable and reasonable to me that the universe itself is this Necessary (unconscious) Being.";7;1;2;"It is not"
