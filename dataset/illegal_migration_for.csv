2054;immigration;"Inmigrants should be given rights but only after they have given saomething back to the place they have been living at, for example, military service, charity services, law enforcement, enforcing education and cultural growth. Anything that can be recognized as a real contributioin. Of course any person that doesn´t actually give anything cannot demand anything back.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
1077;immigration;"Absolutely. If they contributed a tangible service to society then they deserve some sort of reward for doing so. Even if they immigrated to the US illegally, it's not their fault the US naturalization process is so long and difficult.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
1068;immigration;"They are already a vital part of our economy, and in many cases have all their roots in this country. If people want to limit or prevent new immigration (legal or illegal), there may be valid reasons to do so, but turning a blind eye to people for years and then suddenly kicking them out of the country is inhumane.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
2054;immigration;"And as for illegal inmigration I think that the key to stop it is assist the home countries of the inmigrants so that they don´t search for a way of subsistence in other places. But I don´t mean give money away, that only generates corruption and inefficient governments, I mean help them to find alternatives for developing their economies, specially if they´re rural economies, that way you don´t help only one inmigrant, you help an entirer nation.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
2054;immigration;"I actually believe that it´s unfair not playing by the rules, but what if you could make some arrangements for people that give a lot to your community, not only to your economy, wouldn´t you endorse that? For example, look at European soccer teams, the finest ones offer assistance to their players so that they can be a part of their corresponding countries, like Rafael Marquez in Barcelona. Of course, on the other side, if they don´t give anything to their "team", how could they expect to get anything back. Again to sports, what if you could get the best baseball player in the world, but couldn´t get him just because he´s cuban? and besides, most countries are formed of inmigrants. America was "founded" by pilgrims that took over native americans´ lands. If they were rejected back then, we might be living in some sort of medieval age right now.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
1299;immigration;"I don't believe in Amnesty, per se, but a defined path to citizenship for people that live in America? Of course! Without immigrants, America wouldn't exist. The glory of America is its melting pot! And if your problem is just that the ones now tend to be illegal, as opposed to the past, you're forgetting that an awful lot of people at Ellis Island weren't legal, either. (The derogatory term for Italian Americans, "wop" stands for With Out Papers, because they were coming here illegally.) But whether or not you agree with the idea of immigration, you've got to admit that these people are here, now. It's not only inhumane to kick them out, it's impractical. They're already living in the shadows. What are you going to do, make a mandatory citizenship card and check everyone? These people are here, and changing our economy (if they're not registered, they don't have to be paid minimum wage...). These people are here, and they're being abused. The solution for both problems is making them citizens. Should they just be given citizenship rights with a snap of the fingers? No, of course not. American citizenship should be earned. They should be enrolled in the same programs that legal immigrants are in, to learn about the constitution, our history, etc. (come to think about it, this should be mandatory for all voters, not just immigrants.)";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
2270;immigration;"First of all it's BS to refer to human beings as "illegal." Even if you think someone broke the law, why can't you say they illegally immigrated, not that they are an illegal immigrant. The action is what is illegal, not the person. Secondly, comparing all documented immigrants against all undocumented immigrants is not a fair comparison. Take a look at the immigration laws in the U.S. The system is and always has been slanted favorable toward Eastern Europeans. The caps placed make it near impossible for someone from Latin America to immigrate legally without a 15+ year waiting period. The quotas that are set and who are allowed to take them are ridiculous. Third, why do you make the assumption that just because something is illegal it is wrong? What authority do we have to draw an invisible line arbitrarily in the sand and say that those on this side of the line are entitled to human rights and those on the other side are not. They are not equal to us because they were born on the other side of an invisible line. It's nuts.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
2270;immigration;"That is an absurd metaphor. By this logic every full-born citizen was born in your house and somehow you don't have to take care of all of them. Every citizen who stayed past their limit on a visa broke into your house, but you took care of them and then eventually you told them they could stay. It is really ignorant to widdle this down to an individual basis. Despite your ridiculous metaphor, this country is NOT private property and if you want to liken it to a house, it is a house with 300 million people living in it already. Those protesters you are talking about already live in the house. The police you are calling live in the house too.";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
334;immigration;"first of all, not every immigrant has the money to do the legal process to get amnesty or anything of that matter next time you hear about a child who had came here illegally to have an education or so their family won't live in poverty, spit in their face and tell them they are worthless because they didn't come here legally and now all they deserve is to go back home in poverty just because they didn't come here the right way";16;0;1;"Illegal Inmigrants should be given amnesty or citizenship rights after a contribution or recognized"
828;immigration;"I personally feel that building a border fence is a waste of tax payer's money. The border is a long stretch of land and even with a fence people will still find ways in if they really want to. The main problem here is cost and not just in the initial fence but in the man power required to watch over it for an indefinite period of time. The better solution would be to truly come up with a plan for immigration and how to treat it rather than just masking the problem with a fence.";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
79;immigration;"i voted for the other side. but after careful consideration, I dont think a fence would do it. I think a stretch of hidden landmines should be installed. Fences require maintenance costing additional tax dollars. Landmines probably doesnt last very long either but you wouldnt know exactly how long until you step on one (tick tick), would you? And I think most people in their right mind would not want to risk being blown up to cross the border. So it should keep the numbers low. C'mon a few fatalities is to be expected. Lighten up. If you get blow up. All your problems goes away. And knowing is half the battle. GI JOE.....";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
375;immigration;"Most immigrants don't get in through a "border run" but are transported in hidden in trucks, ships, and planes. So the fence wouldn't help much.";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
2139;immigration;"Building a fence would violate our natural rights. What kind of authority is there that doesn't allow me to cross a border? Am i an alien to those lands? That's like not letting a chicken get to it's feeding lot, yet we still have to control our economy and infrastructure one way. Yeah it's fine to say from our American houses to these inmigrants to F off since we were here in the first place. Yet did we not take the lands from Native Americans?";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
775;immigration;"We have guns for a reason";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
375;immigration;"This is true, but many also hide in the back of truck (or the bottom of trucks) otherwise legally entering. Or they could boat over like that cuban kid. The fence might help a bit, but it could make guards too lax.";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
1388;immigration;"The first time i heard of this idea, i thought it was a joke. A big fence might keep the ones that walk in the desert out, but the ones that hide in or under cars can still get through.";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
1783;immigration;""I am descended from a more recently immigrated family, personally, but that is certainly off topic. " oh? nice that we made it in before the wall, then!! whew! now let's hurry back 'on topic'!";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
2530;immigration;"[img]http://sfgate.com/c/pictures/2006/05/29/mn_border_fence_1.jpg[/img] not sure if image tags work on here, but if the pic doesnt show,, its what they are in the process of building,, its about 3 feet tall with 3 strands of barbed wire,, ya, like tthats gonna work.";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
1000;immigration;"I think it is absoulutly ridiculous that someone would suggest buliding a stretch of landmines. These are people not animals. The people who are running across the borders are people who want to make a better life for their families. They are coming over to work for barely anything and are will to do whatever it takes. I dont know what needs to be done to help prevent the number of illegal immigrants crossing the border but something humane and fair can be done. Building a wall is not going to do anything. These people are desperate and will do whatever it takes to create a better life for their families. Wouldnt you?";16;1;1;"A fence should not be built, other solutions are available."
3083;immigration;"It is ALREADY allowed. There is a legal process for foreigners to enter and even become legal residents of this country. Corporations and those on vacation make use of legal entrance to our country on a daily basis. We cannot afford to allow people to cross our borders illegally without knowing who they are (criminals, most likely, and terrorists also a threat) or what they are bringing in (from alien plant and animal life that can wreak havoc on our ecosystems to weapons, poisons, drugs, or toxic materials that can be used against us or sold to criminals in our country already). Send us your poor, your huddle masses, but we're not going to sacrifice our national security and more importantly sovereignty by letting hundreds of thousands of undocumented criminals into our hometowns and backyards.";16;0;1;"Yes, It makes moral as well as financial sense to allow immigrants into the United States."
96;immigration;"NO. It's no different than me breaking into your house and taking something out of it which isn't mine. Even if 5000 immigrants out of 7000 immigrants get their citizenship, the damage was already done. We spend our taxpayer money on their benefits. The more they receive, the less we receive. Action must be taken.";16;0;1;"Yes, It makes moral as well as financial sense to allow immigrants into the United States."
3417;immigration;"I’m not saying that all are criminals but if even one death or robbery occurred because of them it was to much. What about legal immigrants? Or even natural citizens? Its ok for the them to committ crimes because they are paying their taxes?";16;1;1;Disagree
3433;immigration;"Perhaps if society were a bit easier on these people, both in the US and in Mexico/Cuba, then they wouldn't have to come illegally!";16;1;1;Disagree
3317;immigration;"What you have made here is a statement with no point to agree or disagree with from what I can tell. You point out that illegal immigrants cause economic and social hardships. Okay, we all know this. But, they are by definition - illegal. Its a self evident statement - like saying drunk drivers are a menace on the roads. So, what exactly is your point? What are you proposing here? Do you have a solution, are you looking for a cause for the problem? This is a good topic, can you set the stage for an arguement?";16;1;1;Disagree
450;immigration;"I found it very curious that Jordyz singled out Mexicans and Cubans because besides Mexico, there are several countries that produce many more immigrants than Cuba. Second of all Jordyz most likley lives in So Florida which is then only place that Cuban immigrants are part of the scene. Finally, Cubans are NOT illegal immigrants because Cubans have a special policy just for them. Any Cuban that touches US soil is not an illegal, he is granted immediate residence because of the "wet foot-dry foot" law. After 1 year and 1 day a Cuban is qualified for official US residency, the "green card" This is a ploicy I have problems with but nevertheless it exists, there have been cases where a ship comes in with Haitians and Cubans, the Cubans stay and the Haitians get re-patriated, bizzarre because Haiti's living conditions and political prosecution are far worse than Cuba The US must bear a great deal of responsibility for causing the conditions in Mexico, Central America, South America and elsewhere that force persons to abandon their homeland and desire to come to the US";16;1;1;Disagree

He in So Cal a true melting pot of Latinos I have learned the differences amongs Latins, they are not monolithic, they are not all Catholics or Chrisitians either, they are Muslims, Buddhists, atheists et al Puerto Ricans are US citizens just as much as people born in Denver or Pasadena, Cubans can not be illegal immigrants because of the wet foot, dry foot law made just for them.";16;1;1;Disagree
450;immigration;"The US breaks the legs of many nations and then accusses them of being cripple. The USa is not the sole factor for the reasons many citizens of the Americas want to migrate to the US but they are a contributer.

The Platt Amendment?, discover them and learn. Remember Contra Gate? The invasion of Grenada?, the Dominican Republic? Check out this landmark book, The Open Veins of Latin America", it is the book given to Obama by Chavez in the recent conference in Trinidad. Here's a review In Open Veins of Latin America Galeano analyzes the history of Latin America as a whole from the time period of the European discovery of the New World to contemporary Latin America arguing against European and later U.S. economic exploitation and political dominance over the region.

368;immigration;"There's a reason people immigrate to the United States. Some people are simply born into poverty. If it were you, why would you NOT come to a land which is rumoured to have more opportunities? Everyone should get a chance at something like America. Granted, there should be some restrictions so we don't become an overcrowded pig sty of a country... but it's about time Americans stopped hogging at least some of their good fortune. By the way, this to denverdannydee especially, just because someone speaks a different language doesn't mean they are some sort of outer space freak. They are people just like everyone else. Maybe you should go to France if you want to know what it's like... some of them are just simply nasty to foreigners, especially Americans for some reason.";16;1;1;Disagree
368;immigration;"You are saying that all immigrants are lazy, dirty, destructive and deadly? That is definitely not true, and I'm sure you know it... if you really believe it, I must ask you to PROVE that they are all of those things.

Will AZ officials stop European looking people to see if their illegals immigrants from Russia, Germany, Sweden or where ever else? No, they would blend in and not be easily spotted as Blacks, Latinos and Asians who will be the ones hassled.

695;immigration;"Immigrants shouldn't be granted citizenship for nothing. They need to go through the same process as everyone else. Illegal Immigrants born in the US can stay if they were raised here. We should say if you want to be a normal citizen then you get out of the country and through the normal process. If you get out within this 6 month grace period you will be granted some special rights to faster citizenship (so that there is some incentive to get out). If illegal immigrants don't get out within the 6 month grace period, they are now on a black list in which they can never gain citizenship and can and will be arrested and deported as soon as they are found. Illegals born or raised in the US have to report themselves to the US government and can go through a process to gain citizenship, but since they were raised here they can stay until citizenship comes. After this 6 month grace period any one entering hospitals in a non-emergency situation ie.

1697;immigration;"Are you freakin serious? You idiots tout that Clinton left us with a surplus! Lemme see, Kennedy got us into the Vietnam war and a Republican got us out. Carter handed over the panama canal and left us with a 40% tax burden and Reagan got us out. Additionally, Carter, just like Obama, got no respect at all by Iran (sound familiar?) and the Iran hostage crisis was a fiasco, which Reagan was barely in office and the hostages finally come home. Remember that bay of pigs invasion thing where Kennedy left our military to fend for themselves and die. Remember that Carter hostage rescue fiasco that got people killed? Remember Clinton and blackhawk down where he removed a battalion of Marines, left a security contingent of delta force and rangers which basically amounted to a small security contingent, yet had them doing forward operations, which resulted in military getting killed. Why was Obama's pick McChrystal removed and replaced by Petraeus? Simple, liberals cannot lead to save their asses! It is that simple! When liberals are in charge, people die, this country gets no respect and places us all in danger. Wake up and look at North Korea and Iran! While Obama sits there and lays blame, Bush did something, so did Reagan and every other conservative leader. Obama is merely going to get us into war with Iran, North Korea and eventually Turkey.

1697;immigration;"The water is bluer???? ROTFLMAO Tax cuts on millionaires and billionaires hurt the economy huh? Do you have an etrade account? Do you? How about Scott trade or some other brokerage account? I will dummy this down for you so that you can understand. I am not good at ebonics, so I will have to write in plain English. There is a poor guy on the street and I give him a $100 bill and there is a rich guy on the street and I give him the same $100.... Let's go over some of the things the poor guy would do with the money.... Buy beer, liquor or possibly drugs... Who knows... Maybe take his kids to McDonalds or even Chucky Cheese... Maybe... What does the rich guy do? Let's say we cut taxes and give every middle and low income family a $1000 a year tax break.... What do they do with the money? Vegas maybe, an extra vacation or a bigger and better vacation in Cabo or somewhere nice like Hawaii.... Hmmmm What does the rich guy do? Why are rich guys rich? It boils down to fiscal responsibility.... Very few poor people have an etrade account or brokerage account. When a poor guy gets money, that poor guy supports corporations like the drug cartels across the border, or the whiskey companies in Tennessee or maybe even McDonalds.... But, does he hire someone with that money? See, rich guys, since they really don't need the money, tend to invest that money RIGHT BACK INTO the economy. That's right! Tax cuts on the rich are the only tax cuts that make sense! You spit out this dumb ass rhetoric about taxing the rich, then you argue at how irresponsible government is touting that only ONE president in the last 110 years actually balanced the budget (which is a stretch to say it was Clintard) yet you want to take money away from those that we should be investing in and throwing it into a money pit called THE GOVERNMENT! Hmmmmm If I were rich, I would say screw you and simply not make any money at all, so you couldn't tax me and allow the economy to stagnate and just live off of my existing money. Where is the incentive since all you are going to do is take my money anyway? Seriously! It is so ironic to me that libtards simply ignore what is going on in Europe and particularly Greece. Socialism simply does not work! What makes you utterly stupid is that you are a typical libtard... Libtards want to punish corporations, yet ask them to give out more jobs. You want to tax the rich, have them provide welfare to the poor along with provide products and services at cheap and affordable rates. You want the rich to provide fuel, electricity, cars, homes and financial services, yet you don't want them to profit. A libtard thinks that a poor man having money is more lucrative to the economy than a rich person who hires and invests in this economy from having it.... Another thing.... Do you want to know the secret on how to control black people? See, democrats figured out that they don't need their white cloaks and their hoods anymore. They don't have to burn crosses or drag a black man behind a truck to control them. All they have to do is throw social programs at them. If someone is on welfare, they are less likely to work because if they do, then they might lose that fee money. They control where they live by what is known as section eight housing. Thereby they can keep them in certain parts of town so that they can be monitored, controlled and they can be with 'like-minded' individuals (better than segregation). Another thing is that if they want the rest of society to also want to keep them in 'their' place, then you distribute drugs, so they remain weak and dependant.";16;1;1;"should we basically grant amnesty to the immigrants"

1697;immigration;"I gots me an idea... How about I remain conservative so that there will be people who can repair what democrats break... economy, military, foreign relations, etc, Also, so that there will be at least some people that are willing to work and pay taxes and support not only workers, but also corporations so that those workers can work, make a decent wage and can provide... Oh, I dunno, maybe health insurance and all that goody, goody stuff that the government seems to think that they can best provide, even though every failed program in this country has government attached to it, including the soon to be bankrupt social security system... I mean farbeit from me to want to invest in those entities that make money instead of wasting it on more and bigger government who cannot even manage a budget, much less make some sort of profit... So, I will remain conservative while the euphoric blissful libtards can safely make up crap, alter history and pat themselves on the back for everything that a conservative does but takes the credit for. How is Charlie Rangel and Maxine Waters doing on their tax issues? It's ok that they don't pay taxes because they are liberal. If they were conservative, then obviously they would be in prison by now.";16;1;1;"should we basically grant amnesty to the immigrants"
