1954;"climate change";"I think when anyone refers to global warming they should tack on theory to the end of it. Their are several reasons why I remain weary about this theory. First of all the amount of data we have to go by is not enough. Not enough to draw any conclusions yet. It is a blink of an eye in the history of this earth and its climate. Some of the data and graphs we do have has even been "adjusted". Everyone knows the great hockey stick graph that has gained much popularity amongst supporters. The big problem with this is they eliminated the medieval warming period. This was accomplished by giving up to 390 times more weight to reconstructed tempuratures. By elimatated this documented piece of history it makes the current slight warming to be nothing out of the ordinary. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/11/05/nosplit/nwarm05.xml The graph on this website that actaully acknowledges the medival warming period makes the current warming trend seem like a nice treat. The next problem I have is that computer models are relied on way to heavily to get the results and predictions that supporters swear by. The funny part is models made in 2002 are already shown to be wrong. If models can not even get a few years ahead right how can we believe so fully in them even 10 or 20 years ahead. How about 100 years? We can't predict what the weather is going to do a day ahead and we definatly can not generate accurate models of climate trends. Especially considering how complex a system it is and how many factors (some we probably do not even know or can not measure) . Another big issue that carbon emissions can not explain is the recent cooling of the oceans since 2003. This also goes against predictions made very recently. So why when carbon emissions are at the highest would the largest mass of water (which absorbs over 80% of the suns rays) start cooling? I am not saying that the 1/10,000 of the atmosphere does not contribute to the tempurature. I'm not saying it does. Think about it logical and in a very large scope, the least this should do is make you call it the global warming theory. Enjoy the warm weather while it lasts...";4;1;3;"No, I do not Beleive in Global Warming"
661;"climate change";"That the global temperature is increasing may be true. But is that a consequence of human behaviour? And if humans do have a part in it, how much is that part? If I piss in a river and there's a flood several kms away, how much is my responsibility? What has been terribly increasing, recently, is the concentration of carbon dioxide. In the past that concentration and the average temperature used to be correlated. CO2 used to vary, in millennias, between something like 200 and 300 ppm. Temperature used to vary between somewere in the -10C° to +2° range. The two values varied more or less at the same time. In recent millennia CO2 has been around 280 ppm and temperature around -0.5C°. In the last fiew decades CO2 skyrocketed to over 400 ppm. If temperature was a consequence of CO2 we would now have average temperatures several degrees above the ones we do have and 1/3 of current land would be below the ocean. In fact temperature is correlated to MANY different causes. CO2 being only one. Is temperature rising? Yes. Are we doing it? Partly yes, but we play a little role in it. Instead of debating how we should reduce CO2 emissions, we should be debating the fact that even if we were to stop any and all emission the temperature would keep rising (it would rise even if we were not here, just it'll do it at a different peace). The problem is not JUST to stop emissions. The problem is we should prepare for a temperature rise. If you think it's hard to convince people they should stop using cars, think how hard it is to convince whole countries/states they should move away before they sink into the ocean. That's what we should be debating.";4;1;3;"No, I do not Beleive in Global Warming"
1851;"climate change";"First, lets clarify that "global warming" is not simply natural climate change, but a climate change that is directly caused by human activity. Given the incredible influence of natural causes of climate change, and our relatively small influence on the entire globe, human caused global warming is suspect from the beginning. So, why do people "believe" in global warming? Two factors fit together: First, it is empowering. Look how much dominion we have over our world. Second, it allows vilification of an easy enemy - corporations. The "science" behind global warming is an odd patch work of data that highlights what the believer wants to hear (the hottest season on record for X location) and ignores the data that runs contrary to the theory (the coldest season on record for Y location). And if a scientist demonstrates significant flaws in the theory, they are conveniently dismissed as "tainted" by corporations.";4;1;3;"No, I do not Beleive in Global Warming"
171;"climate change";"No, I do not believe in global warming to the extent that the media (and Gore) present it to be in this day and age. The earth has been warming for the past 40,000 years, since the last Little Ice Age. The Earth's climate is a non-linear, chaotic system that is impossible to predict. Scientists have yet to prove how much warming is produced by humans, and how much is part of the Earth's natural warming process as it exits an Ice Age. Heres a small hint, the Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce CO2 emissions worldwide in order to combat global warming. Even WITH the USA on board (which it isnt), it would only be able to reduce the rise in temperature by 0.04 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. In other sciences, the percentages of error must be kept extremely low. For the Mars landing, only a minimal percentage (around 2%) was allowed in their calculations, otherwise the lander would blow up on impact. In global warming, scientists' results vary by up to 4000%. Let us go back to the 1970's. Back in the age of Ford there was a catastrophe at hand. Scientific research had shown that the world was slipping into global cooling, and many leading scientific figures were on board. UC Davis' Kenneth Watt back on Earth Day, 1970: "If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder in 1990, but eleven degrees colder by the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us in an ice age.” Similar comments were made by organizations and companies such as International Wildlife, Science Digest, the Christian Science Monitor, and Newsweek. If someone back in the 1970's was to say that the earth would definitely warm in the coming 30 years, it would be considered outrageous. As outrageous as it may be for us to state that global warming is over rated. To quote Mark Twain, "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.” Man can not be the sole cause for the 'soaring' climate change we are experiencing (cities around the world find their average temperatures dropping). The sun's effect on the earth is at an all time high for the last millenia. This undoubtedly must have SOME affect on the climate of the earth. I refer you to the UN IPCC's Third Assessment Report from 2001. After numerous portions stating the impossibility of predicting global warming due to man's incapability to monitor his own behavior (ie. population change, economic change, technological development, and other relevant characteristics of future human activity), it moves on to state “The long term prediction of future climate states is not possible. The most we can expect to achieve is the prediction of the probability distribution of the system's future possible states by the generation of ensembles of model solutions. ” The UN IPCC states that long term prediction is not possible (ie. a century or more). Why? Because as I've mentioned so many times before, the earth's climate system is non-linear and chaotic. As such, no level of linear analysis or comparisons could hold to it properly.";4;1;3;"No, I do not Beleive in Global Warming"

I guess Al Gore and all of these other celebs are in on the joke about global warming, and its gonna be revealed on april fools or something. We are destroying god's earth and we need to start noticing what is happening right now.";4;1;3;"No, I do not Beleive in Global Warming"
1955;"climate change";"1) sniper144: First, the ozone holes seem to have mostly closed up. It appears that they were caused primarily by CFCs, of which production in scale has mostly ceased. To the best of my knowledge, however, this is not considered scientific fact, just the working theory, so I won't push it. Second, as per the ice age, open a geology textbook. You'll find it. 2) jgolla: Ice Ages do not end overnight. Average world temperatures over the past few million years are higher than today. 3) boxosox: Yes, it is warmer now than it was thirty years ago. This is purely anecdotal, however, and if anecdotal evidence is considered admissable, keep in mind that it was warmer in the year 1500 than it now, back when we first started burning coal.. Based exclusively on anecdotal evidence, I could argue that carbon lowers temperatures- I wouldn't. Note that this change is not statistically unprecedented, look up "Younger Dryas". 4) grav3k33p3r: First, the ice took thousands of years to melt. Most of North America was under 60 meters of the stuff. Second, you killed your whole argument by saying "I believe in global warming." I don't "believe" in atoms, I don't "believe" in gravity, I know these things. That you need to "believe" in Global Warming is a damning claim against the theory. 5) embretr: First off, well argued. You have not convinced me, but at least your claims suggest that you have a good deal of knowledge on the subject. I respect that. I would like to attack your correlation of CO2 and temperature. When ice melts, it traps CO2, as well as other gasses (why it floats). Consider: If the planet's temperature were to rise due to some completely anomolous event, such as increased solar activity (fyi: I don't really buy that theory, but let's hypothesize), would not CO2 levels increase due to ice melt? Could not the correlation you mention actually be backwards? I hate to say it, but I think it is. There is no question a warming Earth will have rising CO2 levels, as it will be released as the ice melts faster than nature can absorb it.. The question only lies with the the opposite- and if CO2 increases temperature (as well as being created by increased temperature), doesn't that mean the ball is already rolling and there is really nothing we can do to stop it, even if we stopped polluting, today? Once again, this is all hypothesis, as noted when I say "I think it is." Let me parallel this with another argument, one of religion- consider: I do not "believe" in God, but would never doubt the possibility. I do not "believe" in Global Warming, but would never doubt the possibility. I admire that you are willing to admit the jury is still out on this, as, believe it or not, it actually makes you more credible. Remember Mark Twain: "The only difference between truth and fiction is that fiction has to be credible." 6) 7x16: The last ice age is, technically, still ending. The gaps between them can be from 10,000 years (a 'relapse') to millions of years. Over the last million years or so, the average time between was about 140,000 years. We are due in about 145,000 years. 7) Dan: I like that you at least understand where the debate should be headed. Remember, however, that this recent temperature change is not statistically unprecedented. Once again, "Younger Dryas." 8) spark: re: show: Keep in mind that there are many examples of the majority of scientists being wrong. Otherwise, there would be no use for the word 'breakthrough'. But that's beside the point. You questioned Show on why he feels that Global Warming is a hoax. I, myself would not call Global Warming a hoax, but a distraction. Let's imagine a world where there are no humans, but due to some anomolous event, its temperature was rising. The vast majority of species would prosper due to increased vegetation, most notably in the oceans. Some species would die out, but others would rise to take their place, thus is nature. Humans, having given up their nomadic status, have a great deal to lose, however, if temperatures warm- our largest cities are built on coasts. We cannot simply pick up and move upstream. BUT.... Global warming is not bleaching the coral reefs. Global warming is not cutting down the rainforests. Global warming does not dump chemicals in our lakes. Global warming does not cause breathing problems. Pollution itself is the factual culprit of these things. That you would spend one minute debating global warming deprives these other issues of the attention they deserve, especially since there are enough critics of global warming to really styme the debate. To make matters worse, they have made CO2 the end-all and be-all culprit in this issue, and it is one of the VERY few pollutants we produce that IS NOT A POISON! Plants, apparently, breath this toxic stuff. We can stop pollution and deforestation if we try, but now that Global Warming is the buzzword of the day, nobody seems to bother. It's a distraction. So, are you an environmentalist or climentalist? 9)klm129: The last ice began receding about 30,000 years ago. Geological evidence suggests that, on average, they take longer than that to re-stabilize at normal temperatures. I'm willing to admit that Global Warming due to CO2 is a possibility, are you willing to admit that we still may be seeing oscillations due to an ending Ice Age? Oh, and as for Kyoto, the people who agreed to that document were politicians, not geologists or meteorologists. Their opinions in the matter are as relevant as Al Gore's (a politician/ lawyer /CEO /moviemaker). I would like to end with the solution that all the politicians and climentalists ignore- the most polluting thing a person can do is procreate. Overpopulation is the cause of nearly all the world's problems from famine to war to inequality to, should the theories be true, global warming.

During most of the past 2,000 years, the temp has been about the same or higher. Currently, we are barely over the average for the last 2,000 years. http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2008/02/11/a-2000-year-global-temperature-record/ 2. During the medieval warm period (820 – 1040 AD), Greenland supported farming. Those areas previously farmed are now covered in glaciers. Obviously the melting and reformation of glaciers is a cyclical occurrence. 3. The earth experienced a little ice age which ended around the late 1860's or so. This is about the time man started recording temperatures. This would be like measuring a lake depth after a severe drought, then worrying about it flooding as it rose to normal levels. 4. The earth has been warming for the last 18,000 years, since the last major glacier time period. During this time frame, the glaciers have been melting at a fairly consistent rate. Also, for most of the last 1 billion years, the earth had NO glaciers or ice coverage. http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/index.html 5. The AGW theory states that CO2 is the primary driver of temperature. They arrived at this idea because they did not know of anything else which could cause it. But during the 70's and during the current decade, temperatures dropped while CO2 continued to rise. This means that natural occurrences are driving temp, not CO2. 6. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and sun spots provides a much better correlation to earths' temperature than CO2 levels ever have. http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/warming-trend-pdo-and-solar-correlate-better-than-co2/ http://strata-sphere.com/blog/index.php/archives/5693 7. Polar Bears are experiencing a population boom. Coke sales in the arctics are through the roof. Polar Bears have been around for thousands of years, and remember, we are only at the average for the last 2,000 years. They lived through all the previously warmer climates. The original picture of 2 bears on a floating ice block was a complete scam. The photographer explained that the bears were in no danger and close to shore. The picture was lifted from a public PC by another passenger and sent around the world. 8. Many glaciers are expanding. Even Antarctica is growing on 98% of is land mass. Only 2% is melting. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577399/Christopher-Booker%27s-Notebook.html 9. There is no consensus on AGW. This was a lie that has been propagated by the media. http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckton_papers/consensus_what_consensus_among_climate_scientists_the_debate_is_not_over/page-2.html 10. Yes we emit CO2 into the atmosphere and it is a greenhouse gas, but, we only contribute about .28% of all the greenhouse effect. Water vapor makes up about 95% of the greenhouse effect. CO2 and other trace gases round out the greenhouse gases at about 5% for all of them. Of that 5%, only 3% is CO2, and most of that is natural. Again, our contribution to the greenhouse effect is a paltry .28% http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html 11. The spread of disease is not attributed mainly to temperature. If this were the case, Florida would be a giant festering disease ridden cesspool. Economic standing is the primary determining factor in the spread of disease. Poor cultures can not fight the disease or eradicate the pests like more successful nations. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120778860618203531.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries 12.

Now you said "Man's CO2 output". In all actuality, the cycle of global warming is actually very predictable, meaning that looking at a graph with a scale starting over 400,000 years ago, every 50 to 100 thousand years, average global CO2 levels rise to an approximate 300ppm.

And all the evidence points to climate change happening. The debate isnt "if" it is happening, the big debate is "When" it is happening. You talk about trees and photosythasis and all that jazz. I cant speak on photoplankton, but on trees I can comment. First, photosythisis is a two way street. During the day the trees take in CO2 and use it to change sunlight into energy and in the process expell O2 (oxigen) At night however the plants turn the energy (stored as sugars) into growing power! Using this evergy creates, you guessed it, CO2. Now, there may be more trees now than during that crazy disney movie, but these new trees are just that, NEW! During the young phases of a trees life it produces far less oxigen then at the later stages and produces far more CO2 as well (though it still sucks in more CO2 than it produces). Its the OLD GROWTH trees that have a real impact on CO2 levels. Yep, all those trees we've been cutting down to build houses. The really big ones that take some 200 years to grow.

Point to some evidence for this first off, and second explain to me exactly where this funding is going then? Let me explain a few things about Africa for you. First, most FDI (Forgein Direct Investment)comes from China (infact, over 70% of it) and this FDI comes in the form of resource development. The reason for this is that China is mainly interested in sustaining their development with resources from Africa (and at the same time are doing a good job of opening the market there and developing the nations themselves). FDI doesnt come in the form of raw dollars, it comes in the form of out side corporations or government building things. The net effect on the nation is an increase in GNP and GDP allowing for greater infrastructural growth within the nation. Thus, they are fully capable and able to build any type of plant they want. It seem logical that African states would be the MOST interested in climate change. The vast majority of the population of Africa is still employed in agricultural industires (if you can call it industry).

Proof that this current period is caused by humans. I will infact use the VERY SAME GROUP you used to "prove" it wasnt happening, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Your report was dated 2000, (thats eight years ago) mine is dated 2007 (just one year ago.) http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/i/ipcc_fourth_assessment_report.htm This report "assesses the current scientific knowledge of the natural and human drivers of climate change, observed changes in climate, the ability of science to attribute changes to different causes, and projections for future climate change."

Is that them saying global warming is likely right? Oh, but Elros, they say its only "very likely" which means they are not sure. Thus it probably wont happen, right? Well, I'm not sure, I have a BA in International Relations, that doesnt go far in climate science. Lets examine what the key conclusions were, shall we? "The key conclusions were that: It is "unequivocal" that global warming is occurring, the probability that this is caused by natural climatic processes is less than 5%, and the probability that this is caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases is over 90%." Wow, 90%! Thats alot Elros. I buy car insurance and I am far less sure I'll get in an accident than that! Maybe it would be a good idea to listen to the scientists. But wait Elros, you only have one source, and the IPCC is just a bunch of United Nations Liberal Hippies who want the world to hold hands and hug trees. They arnt a national organization of scientists recognized and respected around the world for its objectivity and scientific credibility like the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) or NAS (National Academy of Science).

Both the AAAS and the NAS support the theory of Anthropogenic Climate Change? http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/climate_change/ http://dels.nas.edu/globalchange/index.shtml Gee wiz! There about as credible as is POSSIBLE. But why not throw out a little a more. http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article516033.ece This one tells us that there is no other explanation than human involvement. Lets address some of your specific arguments. 1. You say I'm a Twit. Response: I know you are but what am I? Grow up. 2. You ask, how much of "your side" of the argument I have studied. Response: Alot. I am aware of the "theory" that the sun has gotten hotter and that is why the earth is warming. I am aware of the argument that this is all part of the natural trend. I have listened to what Nigel Calder had to say. I have read both sides of the issue, done independent research, and came to a conclusion. Just because you wrote some paper for an undergrad degree doesn’t mean you somehow know more than everyone else. I've done my homework and I'm happy to hear you did yours. 3. Something about charity organizations, you believing in climate change and polar bears. Response: Maybe you shouldn’t go to charity sites to get your facts? Just a recommendation. 4. "Real Scientists" that oppose the global warming theory. Response: Really man, give me some sources. I checked out your "juckscience" page and found that all it did was reframe the same data. They ask a question "But we're responsible for all the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect?" and then answer it themselves (the straw man fallacy if anyone is paying attention) by saying something along the lines (exactly copied infact) "Gracious no! Humans can only claim responsibility, if that's the word, for abut 3.4% of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually" This doesn’t seem like all that much. But lets look at some facts presented by NASA, Oceans put out 90 Gigatons of CO2 a year (that’s our little friend phytoplankton and stuff) Plants and Land stuff (really mostly trees and shrubs and other greenies) put out 120 Gigatons of CO2 a year. Us little people, well we only put out 7 Gigatons a year. That’s like 3.4% or something of all the CO2 out there! That’s not very much at all. I guess those folks at junk science are right. Gee wiz, you made a believer out of me. Hold on a second, whats this? Those little ocean guys also take in Co2? They take in 92 Gigatons of CO2 a year!? Holy cow! And land stuff takes in 121 Gigatons a year?! If you put those together that’s a Net outcome of Negative Gigatons! That might explain the cooling you folks all talk about happening over the last thousand years. So wait…. We have nature making -3 gigatons of CO2 a year, but were making positive 7 Gigatons! Where does it all go? Well, I don’t want to lie to you. 2 of our Gigatons go into the oceans, 1 goes into plants and stuff, and two of it just disappears! (the mystery sync as they call it sometimes). But that’s still 1 Gigaton of CO2 going into the atmosphere. While 1 Gigaton may not seem like a lot, remember, that’s 1 Gigaton for at least the last 5 years. Check out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29v4FZvhvcc for a real nice explanation of it. He explains how this 1 Gigaton EXACTLY matches up with the increases in CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Infact, watch this guys entire set of movies (about 3 hours in all I think). Your little debate by the Rosenkranz Foundation is nice but doesn’t really prove anything. All it proves is that one side was better prepared than the other. Which makes sense seeing as the Rosenkranz Foundation is funded by the CATO institute. (The CATO institute isn’t exactly what you would call “non-biased”) To sum up my three page rebuttal, you claim I only shoot rhetoric. Fair claim. For a while there I was just pushing up the generalities I remembered from previous research. Now you have credible evidence provided by Scientists. Your claims hold no water. Your sources are biased and omit facts to prop of their side of the argument while presenting the opposing view in as disfavorable a way as possible. Once again, there is no substance to your argument. I have presented substance (that I’ll admit may have been lacking in my previous 99 posts on this subject) and now the burden of proof is on you. Why should I not believe the worlds smartest people, who have studied the issue for years and understand the intricacies of a chaotic system, in favor of a handful of you? A college kid who wrote a paper, or a website called “junkscience” which provides little support for any of its claims and when it does grossly misrepresents the data? The burden of proof is on you. *****Edit: I am sorry, my opening Paragraph was a little harsh and out of place.

No one on this site, convinceme.net, will be able to speak with any credibility first hand. It is far too easy to lie and far too difficult to prove you are any sort of expert.

After hearing the anti-anthropogenic global warming position about a zillion times from a wingnut friend of mine (I was once one myself and still count many as friends), I decided as a good philosopher, to really put it to the test. Try to really find out.... So, I searched a variety of websites for information against global warming and found a right-wing "think tank" that had a list of something like 400 top experts who supposedly had written papers proving that any warming we might be experiencing has nothing to do with humans. I decided to write their experts, many of whom were at top universities, to see what they really thought. In each case I had to find their e-mail address myself, so it took many hours just to compile the first 40 or so --- but it was enough to convince me.... Out of the first forty, every single one agreed that global warming is happening and that humans are a cause. All but one said that humans were the main cause. All but one said that the warming represented a serious (maybe even catastrophic) problem. Several of them commented on the fact that there was a scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming exists. My conclusion... the think tank was lying through its teeth. Interestingly, a few of the scientists tried to figure out how their research could have been so completely mischaracterized. In each case they figured that the compilers had used some of their 10-20 year old papers from back in the heyday of research on solar cycles. That research suggested solar cycles were responsible for many hot and cold periods in the past. But that research, though still considered good, cannot and does not account for current warming trends... trends which only anthropogenic models account for. These and many other researchers I wrote called the use of their research by the think tank a fraud. More than one mentioned the repeated abuse of their research and one even said he had an ongoing lawsuit with an oil company over the fraudulent misrepresentation of his research. It took me a little time and effort, but in the end it became clear to me that there is no significant doubt in the scientific community that anthropogenic global warming is a real threat.";4;1;3;no

The Earth's temperatures stopped CLIMBING (i.e. warming) about 9 years ago....yet the emissions keep climbing. (Please, note, climbing is the 'rate of increase': no more 'warming' means the temps are not getting HIGHER...) 3. The IPCC report (executive summary, page 17, if I am not mistaken) clearly states that is NOT considering any CO^2 emissions from volcanic sources (among others).....and then concludes that from among the sources it DID consider, human activity MAY be significant....EXCEPT THAT the volcanic sources of CO^2 are several THOUSAND TIMES more than all the human emissions put together.... 4. More and more scientists (like actually ones who study the climate, not geneticists or virologists or some other field about as connected to climate science as poetry is) are announcing that given latest data, they want to make sure everyone knows they don't think AGW is a real thing. 5.

1342;"climate change";"The problem with this topic is that both an increase of CO2 in the atmosphere and the sun both play a role in global warming. Without the sun, there is no heat, and with no heat, there is no global warming, but more of a permanent ice age. Without the overabundance of CO2 in the atmosphere, along with other greenhouse gases, heat would be able to dissipate into space much easier as there is less of a blanket effect which traps the heat in. In all actuality, the cycle of global warming is actually very predictable, meaning that looking at a graph with a scale starting over 400,000 years ago, every 50 to 100 thousand years, average global CO2 levels rise to an approximate 300ppm. This evidence has been gathered from geologists who take core samples of earth in places, mesuring the amount of CO2 trapped in it. However, the question being asked is whether humans have contributed to the rise in CO2 levels. The answer is a simple yes (and it is completely undisputable), however, it is not the only cause of global warming, and in fact not too much to pose such a large impact on the world as a whole. Man has some do do with current global warming, as since the Industrial Revolution, global CO2 levels have risen an additional 100ppm. However, what most people don't realize is the entire Global Warming issue is more of a media issue - something to give them a topic to talk about when there is nothing else going on and also a political issue, as when a political member sounds concerned over the issue, they look good to the public.

Now, Methane is not being released in the same quantity as CO2 (CH4 is only about 20% of all greenhous Gasses) but it is very NATURAL.

If you can have an advanced nuclear weapons program, or an advanced space-program, I don't believe you can hide behind the veil of poverty when sacrifices need to be discussed. In addition to this, I don't neccessarily subscribe that every country needs to go through a "coal phase" or a "cheap energy" phase.

Global warming and climate change affects countries all around the world, and no country/continent (except Antarctica) is not contributing to this problem. When this problem has become so serious that scientists predict that we will only be able to sustain ourselves for another 50 odd years, it is not the time to divide the responsibility of saving our world between countries. It is everyone's responsibility to help save our planet for our future generations. Moreover, why should developing countries rely on developed countries to help save their own children and future generations? What makes the developed countries obligated to do so? Who would be able to 'make' the developed countries actually take a higher obligation? These are all important considerations. It may be true that developed countries may have more resources and ability to take action and help the world, but the underdeveloped countries and the developing countries should not try less or care less merely because they don't have as much resources. They could help the world from another aspect: e.g. saving electricity, water etc. instead of building nuclear power plants.

Inferior economical status and political/social status should not be an excuse to give the responsibility of saving our future generation to richer and wealthier countries. For one, this is not fair to those developed countries--why should they use their resources to save the future generations of others? Moreover, there are many different aspects in tackling climate change: recycling, saving, building power plants, researching alternative energy etc. Although these aspects may require different financial resources, it is not that one is more important the other, for the world would not possibly be saved without any one of these aspects. We cannot say that one is superior. The world belongs to everyone, and it is everyone's responsibility to save the world. Like people, different countries have different strengths, and perhaps developed countries could be responsible for researching and building power plants whereas other countries could recycle and save. Perhaps the UN could also establish programs where the developed countries help the developing and underdeveloped countries NOW, and when those countries prosper in the future, money or goods/products could be paid back.

That their movement North - and re-birth as 'polar bears' is the direct result of loss of habitat in more southern latitudes, for which they are better adapted?

Anyways, I would love to compare data. Having been to both the arctic and the antarctic(both were extremely fun by the way) I have collected data that shows that both caps are actually increasing, hold on, not in width, but in depth. The ice caps are growing deeper. Which makes sense, cause at the rate the width decreased, Long Island should have been submerged about 3 years ago. But hey its ice, it's not a solid land mass, it tends to shift. As for the uber-cute polar bears: First of all, I love you completely ignore Xanni's point about how they used to be river bears before human settlements drove them north. To build on that, many animals can easily adapt to changes in the environment. You make it seem that if the status quo is not kept then nature herself will fall into disarray. Sorry to burst your bubble Bricheze, but Mother Nature is always changing. She never has a "constant." Sure we have natural law and the like, but when it comes to Nature's conditions she is just as wild as a drunk college girl at a frat party. The polar bears will adapt to nature's change. It's NOT our fault. Those ice caps have grown and withered, grown and withered age after age. Also here is a sad truth about nature. Animals who don't adapt go extinct! It's natures way to keep populations at bay. So if the uber-cute polar bear population does go extinct, too bad, so sad, moving on. (By the way, Alaska is having problems with the growing amount of Polar Bears, I'm pretty sure if you bring up withering polar bear population in Alaska, theyd throw you outside to explain that to the bears themselves) So Bricheze, I admire your adamant position and how valiantly you fight, but in all honesty, more and more people are starting to see the hypocrisy of climate change and the people who constantly try to push it down our throats.

451;"climate change";"Actually, I am a scientist. I have a degree in both biology and chemistry so I'm not just blowing smoke here. Is global warming man-made...no. Have humans possibly sped up global warming...probably. But the question was not 'have humans sped up global warming', the question was 'IsGlobal warming caused by humans'. If you ever look at graphs of the ice ages the earth cycles are cyclical: ice age -- interglacial periods -- another ice age. Ice ages and the interglacial periods fall in pretty regular patterns. Earth is usually dominated by ice ages and glaciers. Approximately, every 100,000 years the climate warms up and there is a temporary reprieve from all that ice. These periods are called 'interglacial periods'. So the global warming we are seeing is a natural phenomenon that actually started 18,000 years ago when the earth began to emerge from the Pleistocene Ice Age. About 15,000 years ago, the world got warm enough to stop the advance of the glaciers and for the sea levels to rise. Around 8,000 years ago, the land bridge that spanned the Bering Strait was covered with water and halted the migration of humans and animals to North America. Since the end of the Pleistocene Ice Age, the earth's temperature has risen approximately 16 degrees. So this global warming trend actually started well beforeGlobal warming started long before the Industrial Revolution and/or the invention of the internal combustion engine. Actually, the trend started well before modern day in the BC period. The 'interglacial periods' are global warming periods are they are a natural part of the earth's cycle. Also, the 'interglacial periods' tend to last 15,000 to 20,000 years. We are currently at 18,000 years in the current interglacial period which means we are very close to the end of this warm period before then next ice age should begin. I think in trying to halt global warming that we are trying to halt a natural progression on earth. Humans didn't start global warming. We may have sped it up a tad and probably not hugely at that. The earth is almost ALWAYS in an ice age with just brief reprieves. We are in one of those short reprieves now and it looks like we are at the end of the so-called reprieve. The earth ALWAYS warms up before teh next ice age. That's actually what causes the next ice age. The polar ice caps melt and cool the oceans causing the ice age to spread with the ocean's current...meaning that Europe should be hit first and then it will work it's way around the world. Everyone is so quick to blame everything on humans. I'm not saying humans are perfect, but even we are not responsible for global warming other than maybe speeding it up a tad.";4;1;3;"It is more likely that global warming is caused by a natural cause then by humans"

Which ever country is home to the creation of non-oil based sustainable energy will have the equivilent to the nuclear bomb in the economic future. Why are people in America using labels from the 1960's in political debates instead of embracing the idea that clean energy is better, no matter what, and IS the future, so we should be all over this like NASA was the moon!";4;1;3;No
