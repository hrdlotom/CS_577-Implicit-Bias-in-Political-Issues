613,evolution,"I see your points and they are valid. However, if you read up on your science you will realize that a large amount of science communities believe in a creationist of evolution. They look at the facts of order and possibilities as well. If you wanna call God a Sky Daddy, then I believe I can be just as skeptical about the universe and all of its order coming together from random parts of nothing. Its as if a BMW were formed from car parts just because you threw them together millions of years ago. Sorry folks but that is harder to believe for me than a someone or something orchestrating everything through order and detail.",7,1,Creation

1212,evolution,"Ah Creation vs Evolution. A debate that is essentially the debate since the release of "The Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin in 1859.
Now let's look at each. In evolution, the general theory is that "populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection." Where as in Creation, the explanation is that someone/some being/some force created life as we know it.
While evolutionary theory is a scientific theory (which is based on facts, creationism is more a belief or rather "faith based" as one puts it. At first appearances, it would seem that evolutionary theory has the upper hand since it "evolves" as discoveries are made. Whereas creationism fails because it's a set story and as inconsistencies are discovered, the belief becomes invalidated.
But the idea that evolutionary theory "evolves" is essentially saying that the theory can "change" to fit the discoveries made. In essence, evolutionary theory is allowed to "change" its story provided that there is evidence to support a change.
Creationism on the other hand, as a belief is based on faith not science. It's a belief that puts the responsibility of creating life into a "Creator" whether that creator is God, Shiva, the Force, or whatever is not the focal point.
Oddly enough, Creationism seeks to explain the what I call the "moment" that started it all. Whereas evolutionary theory seeks to explain our past but not necessary the moment in which it all began.
After all evolutionary theory states that all life stems from a common ancestor. But where did that common ancestor come from? In current evolutionary experiments, we can see microevolution and a limited degree of macroevolution. We can show how a primal soup of chemicals can form basic amino acids given certain conditions. We can show how single cell organisms can form into multi cell organisms. Yet to this day we can't show how basic amino acids can form a single cell organism.
Science can discover and explain a lot of questions. Yet even now there are questions that science can't fully answer. Sure science can tell you that as a species your goal is to procreate and ensure the survival of your genes, but science can't tell you exactly what is your purpose in life.",7,1,Creation

1201,evolution,"The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.",7,1,Creation
1201,evolution,"God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about.
Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to get your hands around.
It's funny that the supposedly unsophisticated ancients would all choose to believe in an abstract concept rather than a concrete one. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?",7,1,Creation
1201,evolution,"One of evolution's major problems is a moral one. Evolution states that creatures change over time. When a creature is more fit than those around it, it takes over. As a result, the best creature rises to the top. It is claimed that all this is in the best interest of the species.
If that were true, it would justify a whole bunch of things that most people disagree with. White men kept slaves in the South, and slavery stuck around for some time. And when the slaves were freed, they didn't free themselves - white men from the North did most of the work. Does this mean that white men were more fit than the slaves and that the plantation owners were justified in keeping slaves?
There are plenty of other examples. Terrorists (and their American counterparts), the Darfur conflict, feudalism... Evolution implies that the side with the upper hand deserves to win. This post isn't a very scientific argument, I know, but I don't think I could ever accept the "might makes right" mindset.",7,1,Creation
1201,evolution,"I stand corrected - there is rigor in evolutionary research. However, not all of it is scientific, and a lot of it is based on exaggerated facts, half-truths, and assumptions.
I mentioned the dates in rock strata for two reasons. First of all, my post was a reply to burnman, who claimed the Earth was older than 10,000 years. Second, geology, which I concede isn't the exact same thing as evolutionary theory, is still very important. Evolution requires incredible amounts of time - if the proposed periods of time don't line up with the strata or the fossil records the strata contain, that's a pretty big problem with evolution.
I found The Origin of Species on Wikisource and am reading through it. Any interesting passages?",7,1,Creation
975,evolution,"Unfortunately, the title of this discussion is wrong. Instead of being Evolution vs. Creationism, it should be:
Does God exist?
Creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. Creationism implies that a Higher Power, a God, orchestrated the creation of this planet and its inhabitants. Evolution may very well have been one of the tools used to accomplish this.
As to whether God exists (however you choose to define God), each person has to decide for themselves.
I look at the world around me, the thousands of beautiful plants, animals, etc, and think that their must be a Higher Power behind it all.
Mathematically, it seems like it would take much more than a few billion years for a world to evolve by chance to what we experience today. It could take a few billion iterations just for someone to guess my password. It doesn't make sense to me that the earth could evolve to what it has become in its short (few billion years?) history by chance.

1201,evolution,"The different parts of the embryo don't grow at the same rate. What looks like a tail is really the spine, which develops earlier and starts off longer than the rest of the embryo. The body then "fills it out," so to speak.
There are several other features that are often cited as evidence of evolution, such as "gill slits," "yolk sacs," and other bits and pieces that were supposedly left over from evolutionary ancestors. However, many of these comparisons are based on appearance, not function. Just because something looks like a _____ doesn't prove that it used to be a _____.
Many frequently cited claims of evolutionary leftovers in the embryo are part of the theory of recapitulation. This theory was widely published in old textbooks and so remains a common misconception, but nowadays even mainstream scientists reject at least most of it, as it was based mostly on guesswork and exaggerated illustrations.",7,1,Creation

If evolution is true....
How come people aren't still evolving?",7,1,Creation
975,evolution,"jwdunn, first of all, I appreciate the tone of your post, so I chose to reply to you even though you weren't the only one to make some of your points.
Two points:
1. RE: this couldn't happen by chance.
First of all, my understanding of the universe is too limited to know if 13.7 billion years x 150 billion galaxies x 1 trillion stars x 5 planets per star makes for good odds or bad odds for a planet to exist by chance that has the right orbit, spin, tilt, elements, etc to support life.
However, for life to evolve like it has from essentially nothing on such a planet in just a few billion years by chance seems pretty far-fetched to me.
Even still, suppose mathematically it isn't so far-fetched. It still doesn't invalidate creationism. If evolution was a tool used by God to populate the earth, He might have "only" set the Universe in motion to accomplish this, or, in my opinion at the moment given my limited understanding, He might have used "accelerators" to speed up the evolutionary process so that we could reach this point in "just" a few billion years.
2. RE: Creationism is an argument that came from a time when humans believed the earth was the center of the universe.
Creationism came from, and still comes from, people who devote significant effort to trying to commune with God--whoever God is. Millions, or billions, of people claim that they are able to pray to God and feel his influence in their lives. That has been true for thousands of years, and continues to be true today.
Just as I have no way of convincing someone who refuses to honestly devote effort to communicating with God that he does exist, there is no way for me to be convinced that he doesn't exist.
Finally, if God is all knowing and all powerful, the implication is that God knows science perfectly. As a result, it makes perfect sense to me that he would understand and use tools like evolution (that we only partially understand) to accomplish his designs.",7,1,Creation

However, the old "this couldn't happen by chance" argument just doesn't work to defend Creationism, in light of recent scientific findings. Consider a crude version of the famous Drake Equation:

1212,evolution,"However, the fact remains that creationism is not inserted into Evolutionary theory on the basis that there are no "scientifically reproducible" evidence that gives credit to creationism.
That's why there's a difference and that's why we're having this debate.
Now looking back at my original post, the definition I set forth for Evolutionary Theory is the one that is commonly accepted from the works of Charles Darwin in the Species of Origins which was (as aforementioned) in 1859.
Using that basis for evolution theory was my starting point. Naturally if you wanted to use a different definition for your starting point then yes I might be incorrect.
But I digress, let us examine your defining point then. Evolutionary theory, according to you, is the general theory about how life came about. Based on natural selection and the predominance of certain genes being passed down from generation to generation (which also meant that some genes were not passed down). And while there is significant evidence to support this theory, there is little evidence of how it started. How did a lifeless planet "form" life? What was the first starting point? The first formation of an organism from various building blocks? The first generation to "pass its genes" to the next? For these questions, Evolutionary theory has no answer.
Creationism does however have "general" answers. Now I realize that some may point to the fact that these "answers" are typically very vague (i.e. how does a rib from a man be formed into a woman?), but consider the author and audience at the time. Examine how you would go about explaining electricity to someone from the 8th Century A.D.
Now going back to my original point I do concede that I digressed in the last paragraph, but let me instead end with examining logicchop's analogy of evolution theory is similar to the scientific view that matter is made up of smaller things.
Odd that one would choose that particular example as our knowledge of that field has come to some serious dead ends. Now I'm no physicist, but I did take a few classes back in college.
Sure matter is made from smaller things (i.e. atoms) and those atoms are made up of even smaller things (i.e. electrons, protons, and neutrons) and those things are even made up of smaller things (i.e. leptons, quarks, etc.). Yet despite the various theories (both true and false) we have yet figured out how these atoms came to be. Did something create these leptons and quarks? Where they pre-existing? Did the transfer of energy create these leptons and quarks? If so who created the energy?
The problem now becomes a hundredfold more complicated as various scientific theorems, laws, and principles invalidates possible explanations to this unique phenomenon. The explanation is considered the Unified Field Theory, a holy grail of sorts for the scientific (particularly the physics side) community.

975,evolution,"----------------
However, I don't think standard "polite" argument is going to convince any creationists that evolution is true. Creationists have been brainwashed by forces in their childhood. From birth, they have been indoctrinated with false truths. To reverse this, they need to be shocked out of their stupour. Of course, what they really need are sessions with a psychiatrist, perhaps with shock treatment.

That's a little silly in my opinion. Everyone comes with their own biases. To paraphrase a Christian saying, you might want to consider removing the beam in your own eye before trying to help Creationists remove the mote in their eyes.
----------------
I think we might need to redefine Creationism for the purposes of this debate. Shouldn't it be limited to the appearance of humans in the historical record?
Evolutionists: "Humans evolved over millions of years from earlier forms of life."
Creationists: "Man was created by God in the Garden of Eden and Woman was created from one of Man's ribs."
Or have creationists accepted all of the scientific evidence of evolution?
----------------
I disagree. Creationists believe that some Higher Power, a God, is responsible for creating the universe--including this planet and also man.
Evolutionists (as pitted against Creationists) believe that there is no God behind all that we know to exist.
There may be some Creationists who believe that God literally created Adam in the Garden of Eden, but there are others who don't even believe in the Christian God--let alone Adam and Eve.
I am a Christian and believe in the divinity of Jesus, but that doesn't mean I have to believe that the Bible is entirely correct or that it is literal. I embrace learning through the scientific method and have had no problems whatsoever accepting both my Christian beliefs and scientific learning at the same time. So far, I have seen no conflicts between the two.
The conflicts come when people want to extrapolate from what we have actually learned through science and create "theories" for which we have no real proof. The science of evolution is interesting and educational. The theory that God doesn't exist because of what we learn from scientific observations is just that--a theory--no more provable than the idea that God does in fact exist.
Unfortunately for evolution, the scientific principles and learnings are unnecessarily grouped so tightly with the theory that God doesn't exist that the two are effectively merged into one for most people. That is obvious in the classroom, in this thread, and anywhere the topic of "evolution" is brought up.

Religion is effectively a collection of beliefs that typically include some answers about what right and wrong are, why we exist in this universe, and so on. You may not call your set of beliefs a religion since the word "religion" is typically tied to belief in a God. However, they are your own substitute for organized religion.
I believe in science just as much as you do. The difference is that I don't then put my faith in theories that go FAR beyond the science while condemning others for not accepting my beliefs.

828,evolution,"This is an interesting debate in that there is so much confusion regarding what it actually means that it turns into more of a religious fight than anything else.

I love the fact that many on the evolutionary side have clarified that evolution only explains the history of the world around us, not it's origins. Also, intelligent design does require faith that there is a supreme power out there whatever name you want to apply to it.
For me, I personally go for the Christian God created the universe around 10,000 years ago. I know many in the scientific community will argue it, but I am a Christian and believe that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. I have also read many articles that state many scientific facts that help to support this idea (see www.icr.org).

What would you say is the very best evidence for creationism?
Does good evidence exist for creationism? Can that evidence for creationism be classified as very good evidence? If so, what is the very best evidence for creationism?
Creation is one of two possible origin explanations. Both life and everything we see was either created or it evolved by a random process. Consequently, any evidence against evolution is very good evidence for creationism. Alternatively, evidence for creationism can be direct evidence rather than evidence against evolution. To identify the very best evidence for creationism, we need to look at both the best indirect evidence (against evolution) and the best direct evidence for creation.
Evidence against evolution:
There is much evidence against biological macroevolution. Some of Darwin’s evidence used to support evolution is now refuted because of more modern scientific evidence. One fact is that body parts or entities could not have evolved gradually. Michael Behe discovered that cells were irreducibly complex. They needed every single chemical and part to function. Consequently, they could not have gradually evolved. Another evidence was the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record.
We have not been able to create life from non-life regardless of how hard we have tried. We have not been able to create one species from another even with human intervention. The things that have been used as examples of evolution either have supported microevolution or have been hoaxes, frauds, or have used artistic license to extrapolate conclusions without justification.
However, the best evidences against macroevolution and hence the very best evidence for creationism, is the unimaginable complexity and machine-like workings of a single cell including DNA, RNA, and the manufacture of proteins, etc. None of this was known during Darwin’s time. They thought the cell was a simple blob of protoplasm. The human genome contains so much information it would fill libraries if contained in books. The machine-like workings of a cell have been related to our most sophisticated factories. Nobody would ever suggest that random processes could generate libraries of information or make a manufacturing plant. This favors creationism.
Direct evidence for Creation:
The Big Bang theory is the current scientific explanation of our origin. It places the origin of our universe at a specific time in the past. So whether we believe in science or believe in creation or both, we believe we came from nothing at a specific time in the past. The difference is that the Big Bang states that everything was created from nothing without a cause or a purpose.
Alternatively, if we believe in creation, we believe that everything came from nothing by the will of an omnipotent, transcendent Creator that is not limited to time and space and we were created for a purpose. This completely explains how apparent design and complexity could have come into existence.
However, the very best evidence for creationism is the claim by God Himself that He created light, the universe, the Earth and all life. You might question whether that argument holds up under scientific scrutiny? We all know the creation story in Genesis, but how can we know directly through scientific rationale that it is true. We can show that it was written in the Old Testament, but how can we show direct evidence that it is true? We only need to accept the most thoroughly documented history in existence and examine the evidence for who Jesus was. Our calendar is based upon the birth of Jesus. How historical is that? In Mark 13:19 (NKJV) Jesus stated, “For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of creation which God created until this time, nor ever shall be.” Could Jesus have been anything other than what He claimed to be, the God of creation?
C.S. Lewis in “Mere Christianity” addresses the possibilities of who Jesus could have been. He concludes that He couldn’t have just been a great moral teacher. He had to be the Son of God, a lunatic or the Devil. He certainly wasn’t a lunatic or the Devil so He had to be the Son of God. If He is the Son of God and He said God created everything, then this is the very best direct evidence for creationism.

"It is inherent in any definition of science that statements that cannot be checked by observation, are not really saying anything—or at least they are not science." —*George G. Simpson, " The Nonprevalence of Humanoids, " in Science 143 (1964) p. 770.
"In accepting evolution as fact, how many biologists pause to reflect that science is built upon theories that have been proved by experiment to be correct, or remember that the theory of animal evolution has never been thus approved." —*L. H. Matthews, "Introduction," Origin of Species, Charles Darwin (1971 edition).
"Evolution is baseless and quite incredible."—*Ambrose Flemming, President British Association for Advancement of Science, in The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought.
"Present-day ultra-Darwinism, which is so sure of itself, impresses incompletely informed biologists, misleads them, and inspires fallacious interpretations . .
"Through use and abuse of hidden postulates, of bold, often ill-founded extrapolations, a pseudoscience has been created. It is taking root in the very heart of biology and is leading astray many biochemists and biologists, who sincerely believe that the accuracy of fundamental concepts has been demonstrated, which is not the case." —*Pierre P. Grasse, The Evolution of Living Organisms (1977), p. 202.
Evolutionists tend to ignore both deductive factors (principles, natural laws), and inductive discoveries (scientific facts).
"Charles Darwin claimed to have created his theory of evolution by means of natural selection 'according to the true Baconian principles of induction.' In fact, he did no such thing, but it was customary in his day that a true scientists worked by finding patterns or laws by gathering great quantities of 'facts.' " —*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution (1990), p. 236.
The inductive method gathers the facts and then decides on patterns they form, and laws to be formulated from them. But *Darwin devised theories, irregardless of the facts.
Sedgwick, the well-known geologist who was first to teach *Darwin something about the subject, wrote this to the author of Origin of the Species, just after it was published:
"You have deserted the true method of induction and started off in machinery as wild as Bishop Wilkin's locomotive that was to sail with us to the Moon." —Adam Sedgwick, Letter dated January 1860, to Charles Darwin.
ARRIVING AT TRUTH BY LARGER ANALYSIS—A major flaw of the so-called "scientific method" is its insistence that it can include in its field of studies only that which can be submitted to a rather quick little experiment. How much electrical voltage is needed to make a frog's leg move? The scientists can figure out that one. Which helps people more: Christianity or atheism? Scientists have no way to analyze that in a laboratory, so they throw up their hands in blank ignorance and declare it to be an unanswerable question; there is no way of telling.
But, using a broader base of experimental analysts, it is not at all difficult to ascertain such conclusions. Scientists will tell us there is no way to test such a matter the first time, and no way to repeat the experiment a second time in order to verify it. —But the experiment is being worked out continually all about us on both large and small scale, and it is being repeated constantly.
The method of testing is by observation of the great law of causal relation over a period of time. This is also called cause-and-effect. Another way of expressing it is, "By their fruits ye shall know them." That is an excellent means of scientific analysis.
Who establishes orphanages to help small children who have lost their parents? Christians or atheists? Who goes into the slums to help people?
How many atheist societies have sent missionaries to desolate places to help people learn a better way of life? How many atheist societies have founded universities for the benefit of mankind?
Which side leads out in efforts to continue the killing of innocent unborn children? Christians or atheists? Which group produces the alcoholics, dictators, and suicides more frequently?
The creation-evolution debate has waged for over a century and leaders have arisen on both sides of the conflict. Which side has resorted to hoaxes, fakes, false claims, threats and coercion to achieve its victories? Which side patiently asks that scientific facts be considered?
Thus we find, evidence that points not only to the relative truth of the claims of each side and to the ultimate truth as to which is correct, but we also learn the effect of each set of beliefs on the minds of those adhering to them. Enough time has elapsed in the controversy that we can clearly see that one theory insidiously destroys human morality and men's perception of truth, while the other rests its case on scientific facts. Yes, there are ways of knowing truth that the "scientific method" refuses to consider.
Charles Darwin was one of his geological students and the two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was aboard the HMS Beagle. However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in the Origin of Species any more than he did in the Vestiges. In response to receiving and reading Darwin's book, he wrote to Darwin saying:
"If I did not think you a good tempered and truth-loving man I should not tell you that ... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly; parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore; other parts I read with absolute sorrow; because I think them utterly false and grievously mischievous. You have deserted - after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth - the true method of induction ..."[3]
1 - Fallacy of Relevance. The argument from irrelevance occurs when the conclusion depends on evidence that does not apply to the same point. The next paragraph would be a true statement:
"Scientists do not yet understand the function of certain body organs. In the past, there were large numbers of organs whose purpose was not known; today there are but few. Each decade more and more information has been obtained about various body organs. The obvious conclusion from those facts is that if organic functions are not known, it will only be a matter of time before further research discloses those functions."
In contrast, evolutionists irrelevantly contend that all such organs lack functions entirely! They declare that such organs have not had any functions for thousands of years, and are leftovers from our animal ancestors! That conclusion bears no relation to the facts. A hundred years ago the functions of dozens of organs were unknown. Gradually functions were found; today nearly all human organs have known functions. Yet certain evolutionists continue to declare that those organs are inherently functionless.
2 - Begging the Question. This fallacy occurs when a person presents his own assurance that he is telling the truth as the reason why his statement is true.
(1) "I have been a scientist all my life, and I can tell you that evolution is true."
(2) "Evolution has been fully vindicated and proven by science; I have witnessed this over and over again all my life."
(3) "You can take my word for it, evolution is true."
Repeatedly, in this set of books, we have observed instances of this blockade to careful thinking. Over and over again, evolutionists have maintained in articles and speeches that evolution has been fully proven, and is accepted universally by all reputable scientists. We are to believe these statements because the one telling us is supposed to be a renowned scientist. No other evidence is given, for, indeed, no other evidence for such statements dare be given. (See chapter 31 and 37.)
3 - Misuse of Authority. This error is similar to the one just mentioned. "Because we are the authorities on the matter, therefore what we say is correct. "
The public is asked to ‘just let the scientists decide for you" as to the truth about evolution. But what is needed is evidence, not statements of assurance by scientists. After 150 years of searching for evidence in support of evolution, we need assurance from facts, not assurance from the men searching for the facts. (See chapter 31.)
Evolutionists tell us that "mutations are the cause of beneficial changes in species, and, ultimately, changes across species. This is so, "we are told, "because scientists are sure it is so. " But the evidence does not support the claim. Not one mutation in a million is beneficial, so how could mutations produce useful change—since literally billions of beneficial—and closely inter-related mutations would be needed in order to produce a new species. (See chapter 14.)
4 - False Comparisons. When two items are wrongly compared in an argument, this fallacy occurs.
The peppered moth argument is an example of this. The one species of moth comes in two different colors. "Because birds ate the dark ones on light-bark trees before the 1850s, and have tended to eat the light ones on dark-bark trees since then, therefore this is a powerful evidence that one type of creature evolves into a different type." But in the case of the moths, they are both sub-species of the same peppered moth, and both sub-species existed before 1800, and today both sub-species still exist. Changes within species does not constitute evolution, and in regard to peppered moths, no change within species has occurred, much less across species. (See chapter 13.)
5 - Argumentum ad Populum. This is an argument addressed "to the people." This occurs when popular feelings are pandered to, when people are told what they want to hear—and what they are told is declared to be a "scientific fact."
(1) "Science is progressive and is itself evolutionary"
(2) "Evolution is the belief of moderns. "
(3) "Everyone that is educated believes this theory."
An implication of much of the evolutionary teaching is that our race has raised itself by its own bootstraps and we will eventually be gods, knowing and doing every possible thing, including inter-galactic space travel. All this appeals to the public, and they are assured that evolution must be true. At least, they surely hope so.",7,1,Creation
987,evolution,"Really.........so how did a bird evolve under the rule of natural selection?
First it began growing nubs on each side. How does that make it more superior or stronger?
The nubs become half a wing? Now the creature cannot fly but is wabbleling around falling over,crashing through the brush and noext it's bones start becoming hollow and brittle.
It would actually become the weakest and easiest to catch and eat. The bird through Darwin's process would never have been.
That's why he is called a nut by his own professor at Cambridge. It does not work. If it did you would show me a fossile of a lizard wth wings....that is called transitional evidence of metamorphosis.

1002,evolution,"I agree with the idea that there is a lot more evidence pointing towards evolution, however I would like to question the nature of this evidence. The fact of the matter is the evidence is worldly and scientific. As humans, we tend to find reason for things. Using science to prove a scientific theory is like saying "cheese is cheese". You're using what you have learned and can never know is really true to prove it is true. The small amount of evidence pointing towards creationism is arguably more philosophical and sometimes scientific, however often times it is regaurded as something beyond our understanding. Our human minds aren't able to fully grasp the nature of creationism, and that is why it is not fully accepted.
As far as creationism being something ancient people have used to explain our natural world, I like to think of it differently. Ancient people had established that the world was created, not just there. Rather than them using it as reason for explaining the world, the architect used the world to explain things to them. Their existence, nature, etc. Plus, the concept of creationism being a longer lasting idea and belief than science calls into question why. And why is it still around? If it is so unreasonable, and science so convincing, why has it not died out?
The reason why was touched upon in your last paragraph. Creationism is something concrete and established. It usually doesn't evolve or change. This solid idea does not expierence huge or incremental advances, but gives reason and explanation and hope and faith, something evolution and science cannot provide. Also, consider why science can often be incorporated into creationism, but usually creationism cannot be incorporated into science.",7,1,Creation

1210,evolution,"Ten Reasons Creation Is A Better Explanation Than Evolution
1) The Universe...How did it originate?
The First and Second Law of Thermodynamics are great evidence for a supernatural entity. The Universe is composed of matter and energy. Is the Universe eternal? No. The Second Law of Thermodynamics teaches that matter and energy are functions of time and that over time they decay. Since matter and energy are functions of time, they can not be independent of time (eternal).
The overwhelming majority of scientists believe the Universe is not eternal. If it is not eternal, it had a beginning.
Was this beginning natural? the First Law of Thermodynamics says it was not. Matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed according to the First law of Thermodynamics. Thus, an atheistic belief that the Universe "poofed" from nothing by natural means is anti-science. It is blind faith. Laws of Science show that belief in a supernatural entity is the best explanation of how the universe began, since these Laws of Thermodynamics falsify atheistic belief.
2) Life...How Did It Originate?
Atheists think life originated by a natural process of chemicals mixing with energy. They can believe this, but it is anti-science and a blind faith belief. The Law of Biogenesis states life only comes from life. This law is the foundation of Biology. Since life did not originate from non-life by natural means, the best explanation is that it had a supernatural origin.
3) Design. A simple definition of design is something that was planned for.
The human body has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in it. The smallest blood vessels are so small, that only one red blood cell at a time can pass through it - after its nucleus has fallen off! Red blood cells lose their nuclei so that they can be small enough to pass through your tiniest capillaries. Piping systems do not happen by chance. Especially ones that are this complex.
4) Information.
You started out as one tiny fertilized egg. Just one cell. Today you are 75 trillion cells. But you are not the same cell over and over and over again. You started as one cell, but now you have skin cells, hair cells, muscle cells, bone cells, nerve cells, blood cells etc! You have over 200 different cells in your body! One cell in your body is in your digestive tract and all it appears to do is to make mucus! Isn't that cool?
And not only do you have all of these cells.....they are in the right place. You don't have bones cells on your eye ball, you don't hair cells in your spine. You are a 75 trillion piece jig saw puzzle with all the pieces in the right place. Jig saw puzzles don't get put together by chance. Do you think you did?
Think. You started out as one cell, but in that cell you contained all the information required to make more cells and produce a living organism with 75 trillion cells, over 200 different types of cells and 60,000 miles of blood vessels.
Information comes from an information giver. Not from nothing, nor by chance.
5) Systems.
Suppose you evolved 60,000 miles of blood vessels by chance. Will it do you any good? No. You need blood, and a heart.
Suppose you evolved blood and a heart and 60,000 miles of blood vessels by chance. Will it do you any good? No. You need a nervous system, a skeletal system, a digestive system, a respiratory system etc. But all of those systems are useless without the circulatory system!
Creation believes in instant people. You can't wait around for a liver to evolve. Creation believes a supernatural entity instantly made humans with functioning hearts, livers, lungs, brains, kidneys, spleens, intestines etc. This makes sense because they all need each other to function and to keep the organism alive.
6) Sex.
Which came first the chicken or the egg? Two chickens, a functional male and functional female (please see chicken and egg article on this web site). For the many animals that reproduce by sexual reproduction, they need male equipment in part of the population and female equipment in the other part of the population. Both systems are very complex and very unique. Once again, creationists believe in "instant people." And that includes instant males and instant females.
My dad is my favorite philosopher. He once said, "You know why Adam and Eve had to be adults? Because human babies are so helpless!" great point dad!
7) Living Evidence.
If the theory of evolution occurred, there had to be transitional forms. These transitional forms were the animals that were the "links" between reptiles and birds, ape-men and humans etc. There would have had to be millions of these transitional forms! But not one is alive today. Why not? Either they never existed or they did exist and all vanished. If they do exist today where are they? If they don't exist today, that is powerful evidence for Creation.
If the theory of evolution is true, this should be true. You have an ape in a cage at a zoo. You pay 50 bucks to look at the ape. If the theory of evolution is true, there should be living organisms that get a 25 dollar discount because the ape in the cage is a close relative.
8) Fossil Evidence.
There are trillions of fossils. yet, in my opinion (trying to be fair here) no transitional forms. evolutionists will claim there are many, but upon close scrutiny, each one can easily be classified as belonging to animals alive today, or an organism that is not transitional, but simply extinct (i.e. trilobites or dinosaurs).
If the theory of evolution is true, there should be millions of transitional forms. Lets suppose the theory of evolution is true. Evolutionists believe reptiles are ancestral to birds. The fossil record should have thousands of fossils of half legs/half wings; half scales half feathers; half reptile feet/half bird feet etc. Yet none of these clear transitional fossils exist. many quotes by Evolutionists support this claim.
9) Genetics and Biochemistry.
To quote my daughter when she was three and talking to a high school girl: "Don't forget, crows make crows."
She is right, and genetics supports her contention. Crow DNA can only make a crow. If you mutate it, you might get a goofy crow, or a dead crow, or an unchanged crow, but you won't get a different animal. Mutations make lung cancer, they don't make lungs.
10) The Anthropic Principle.
The earth has the proper temperature, the proper gravity, the proper amount of oxygen, the proper mass ratio of the electron and proton, the proper charge between electrons and protons etc. etc. etc.
The odds of an average protein getting the proper sequence by chance is enormous. Let's look at the odds.
Imagine an alphabet with 20 letters. Suppose I made a word from this alphabet that was 400 letters long, and asked you to guess the sequence of letters that make up the word. What would be the odds that you would guess it by chance? The odds would be one to 20 times 20 times 20 times 20......400 times! It would be 1 to 20 to the 400th power. This is the same as one to ten to the 520th power. That is a 1 followed by 520 zeros. The odds are greater that you would win California super lotto 500 times in a row than one protein sequence occurring by chance. We are not even talking about a cell, much less an organ, much less a human body.
In statistics, something that is 10 to the 50th is considered impossible. Thus one protein by chance is highly impossible.
Think of this for a second. If the odds against a protein sequence happening by chance is 10 to the 520th power, the odds that it happened by design is the inverse, 10 to the 520th power in favor of it. Those odds make design infinitely more logical statistically than chance.",7,1,Creation
1190,evolution,"1) God created the universe - that means He also created time. Doesn't it make sense then that He is outside time? I know it's a little mind-boggling - our finite minds will never comprehend everything that the Bible teaches. But there is something called faith.
2) God CREATED Adam and Eve. Does that mean they need parents? Generally something that is created does need something before it (other than the creator) to give it life.
3)The Bible does say something about how having sex with your sibling is wrong. But guess what - it was after Adam and Eve. When Adam and Eve were created, they were genetically perfect - without any mutations or diseases which have arisen because of sin. That means that there was no danger in marrying your sibling - they were genetically diverse. Keep in mind too, that Adam and Eve had a LOT of children - Adam lived for 900+ years (due to the perfection of his created body), having children for a good part of it. You can hardly expect the relationship between the children to be the same brother-sister relationship it is now. God made the law against incest after the genetics began to deteriorate, and also as family ties grew closer. (I'm arguing this not because Adam and Eve were brother and sister - they were created as husband and wife! - but because their children would have married each other, as there were no other humans around).",7,1,Creation
1238,evolution,"It's probably nothing particularly insightful but it appears to me that evolutionist are in a bind. To be a scientist today you need to agree with the scope of science -- which is to study observable (direct or indirec) phenomenon in the universe, notice patterns, create hypothesis, conjectures, and theories to account for those observable phenomena. Perhaps somewhat hidden in being a modern day scientist is the assumption -- unstated and unexamined because it can't be examined by science -- that all observable phenomena have a cause which exists within the universe. To posit a cause outside the physical universe for the existence of something within the universe is, by general unspoken agreement, not science. Thus, if the unspoken premise of science -- that all phenomena within the universe have causes accountable from within that universe -- if that is true then either there exists process in the universe by which life evolved, or there is a process completely unknown to science by which we "sprang" into existence in a short, or perhaps relatively short time. The observations, hypothesis, conjectures, etc. of most scientists assume the former since there are, as far as I know, no processes suggested by which what is observed could have happened withing a closed universe -- closed meaning nothing (except perhaps the big bang) can have occured within the universe except by the laws of the universe.
Therefore, the unaddressed debate is not: evolution vs creation, but "open or closed." If science cannot allow for postulating a cause for things in the universe that is outside that universe, then they are practicing a restricted science. This is not to say the evidence they have is not sufficient, good, or even conclusive. It is saying that their own assumption makes it impossible for them to realistically postulate a creationist point of view as scientists. One wonders if they did, and they put as much research into a counter theory as they have in evolutionary theory, if the creationist postulate wouldn't be more respected.",7,1,Creation

Then, MaGiCalLy(ooooooohhhh) this turned into a single cell, and the MAGICALLY by sheer coincidence that bacteria turned into a single cell. Ooohhh this is my favoritepart. After that somehow all of the more cell came together (COINCIDENTALY) and LOOK we have an eye...now how in the world did that happen? O YA! thats right SHEER COINCIDENCE. Now, thay eye need oxygen because goodness knows all tissues need oxygen, so COINCIDENTALY MORE cells came together and LOOK there was a lung. Now of course we need more organs supporting each other to make and organism, so BANG now there are a bunch or organ made out of tissue made out of cells that just coincidentaly fit together.

You're going to tell me, as you say in a later article that the documented history is only like the blink of an eye, so how on earth can we do that?
Your argument then becomes non-falsifiable, just like you always say creationism is. All you have to say is, it's happening so slowly that we can't see it happening. Kind of like the magic words 'God can do everything'.

1211,evolution,"Not all debates are based on evidence, some are based on persuasion, which is the act of convincing by reaching out to one's emotions, feelings, and sensitivity rather than sensibleness alone. I therefore believe that there is no harm nor shame in considering creationism to be the right doctrine to adopt.
I'm Muslim, I believe in Allah, our creator and only God, I also believe that Adam and Eve were the first human beings (Not brother and sister as someone suggested, since they were created by God), furthermore, I believe that God created everything that exists, which includes stuff we're not really aware of, and things that we haven't necessarily seen. All these convictions and beliefs are of course direct consequences of faith since, in your own words, we don't have any tangible and concrete evidence of it. But I completely disagree, everything that surrounds you is as much an evidence that there is a creator as you yourself are, some may argue that nature's extremely fascinating ability to adapt and 'evolve' is capable of producing a miracle such as life and intellect, but the fact of the matter is, no one can explain using "evidence" how nature itself came to exist in the first place.
As someone previously said, Evolution is unable to determine the 'origin' of life and that of the known universe and instead dwells on explaining how it has continuously evolved.
To conclude, I would say that however good nature might be at evolving, in no way would that ability to adjust have been capable of achieving such an incredible balance, precision and sense of purpose.
I believe, in God.",7,1,Creation
1211,evolution,"I think what's happened here is you haven't quite understood what the notions we're debating about actually mean.
Creationism is the current that stresses the existence of a creator rather than believes that everything that we're witnessing is merely a result of some evolutionary chain reactions, what I mean is, it's not "a belief that explains how everything started" And that's it! Which is how you made it sound, it's a belief that tells us that everything, originally, was created and then nature took its course!
Now, to your "who am I and who are you" reasoning, I'd rather debate in an argumentative manner, rather than point out that neither of us, in fact that most of the people on the website aren't exactly "qualified" to debate of anything properly...
Knowing that, here are some people who know what they're talking about : The pioneers of the experimentalist doctrine often say that any scientific assumption is only as reliable and as trust-worthy as its ability to withstand constant testing and experimenting allows it to be, this idea began with the early works of Sir Isaac Newton but also with Galileo's, Pierre Thuilier also added that these experiments will never provide us with scientific certainty, but only give us indirect convincive elements.
On the other hand, the adepts of the more abstract and radical rational doctrine, such as Einstein or Duhem, state that the only way to measure a scientific assumption's correctness is by gauging the homogeneity of its mathematic principles. Karl Popper's criteria for scientific cerainty however is the hypothesis's falsifiability.
Now, I haven't just brought all of these ideas up for nothing. As you can see, the only reason why science cannot explain where everything originated from is because, in either of its major doctrines would a hypothesis stand to reason. And I'm sorry, but that's not good enough for me.
We may be living the pinnacle, and the apotheosis of human evolution science-wise, but I strongly believe that man should NOT abandon the spiritual aspects of his life, they are what separates us from animals, to be brutally honest. Hence, believing in a creator adds a sense of purpose to life, thus allowing us to grow hope, be more positive about our existence and therefore be more productive in every field that we dare explore.",7,1,Creation

1245,evolution,"The problem here is that both creationists and evolutionists are looking for evidence where there is none. By way of analogy, think of acceleration. Acceleration is a change in velocity/speed over time. Compare two vehicles. One accelerates from a stop at a rate of 9.8fps/ps. It takes almost 1100 feet for it to reach a speed of 100 mph. The other vehicle has instant acceleration. Within no time or distance, it accelerates from a full stop to 100 mph. The result of both accelerations is the same. The vehicles are traveling at 100 mph. Thus, from the result, you cannot tell which vehicle had which acceleration.
There are two ways to prove either creation or evolution.
First, we could prove the cause of one or the other. Proving the existence of the Christian God, for example, would prove creation. God by His nature is holy and perfect. He does not lie. Therefore, when He claimed to have created the world, He did. On the other hand, we could prove the existence and operation of natural, physical forces capable of bringing about the world as it is. Both God and the physical forces would be proven in the same way - on the basis of their continuing work in this world.
Second, we could prove creation or evolution by proving the existence of that which can only be accounted for by one of these and not by the other. For example, the incredible design of the universe points to an intelligent designer. Can evolution account for that design?",7,1,Creation

632,evolution,"As someone who has taken, and passed, a high school biology course, let me be the first to tell you that evolution is false and creationism is true. Think about it -- if evolution were true, then we should have flying apes shooting laser beams because this would be the most optimal way to survive. That's just one argument of many that shows how backwards evolution is. Another is the fact that dinosaur bones are here to test us. Also, God changed the speed of light recently so it seems like we're looking at planets and galaxies from a long time ago, but in reality it's just a test from God since he only wants the most devout in heaven and doesn't want to hang around with sinners because he's above that.
Just thinking about it, there's so many reasons creationism is the way to go. Whenever I see a tree, or a pretty picture, it becomes obvious. When I open my Bible and get a fuzzy feeling, it's obvious. The fact that there's not fish running around with little legs should be the nail in the coffin but these stubborn evolutionists keep making up junk like transitional periods and all that.

Please show me the evidence of evolution. The great scientists, including Albert Einstein himself believed that the evidence in science points to a God. No one in their right mind would believe that a super advanced computer evolved by chance out of nothing. It was designed. And you evolutionists believe that our DNA, which is 100 million times more complex than a super advanced computer, evolved by chance?! You might want to rethink your theology. The DNA also gives information that can fill up the Grand Canyon 40 times over. In order to produce information, you need to have a valid source who knows the information himself.

1222,evolution,"What you say is exactly what I believe. Everything is evolving. It's called micro evolution.
For example: dogs are a kind of animal with many different species of dogs within them. Bull dogs and great danes are different types of dogs, but they are still dogs. Even after breeding many dogs together, they came out with chihuahuas, which is a completely useless dog, but it is still a dog. Darwin found plenty of evidence for micro evolution. He noticed that depending on the island and habitats of the birds, the birds' beaks were made different. Each beak specialized and adapted to the area around them in order for them to survive. That was his only evidence. Humans also evolve through micro evolution. Tribes in Africa tend to have larger jaws than humans in America. The only reason is because the humans in Africa use their jaws more often to carry things, while humans in America have cars and other tools to carry things. This is micro evolution in the sense that their jaws adapted to the habitats around them.
The evidence of micro evolution is everywhere. However, the evolution we all think of and debate upon is macro evolution. Macro evolution is an animal turning from one kind of animal to another. An example is a bird evolving into an alligator. That doesn't work and has never been proven. The evidence you just gave was all a part of micro evolution which is the result of animals evolving within their own kind.",7,1,Creation
1244,evolution,"CREATIONISM IS NOT SIMPLY AN ANCIENT STORY! For proof look at the Bible! See some of the stories that God and the Prophets tell, then compare those to things that are happening to-day! Evolution is in fact a story that is laughable! You just believe in evolution because you don't want to believe in God and other religions. You weak-minded soul! There is more proof than anything that God created the world in six days and that is that. Adam and Eve were tricked by the devil to sin against God and that is how sin came into the world. If new parts of evolution are always being added and discarded, then it is not the truth. The truth can not be changed! GOD DOES NOT CHANGE! Therefore creationism is the truth! There is almost no evidence supporting the evolutionary argument and the evidence that is there is fake and comical. Let me recite 2 Timothy 4:3 from the Holy Bible "For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear." I tell you, this is the truth. On and episode of "Hillbilly: The Real Story" on the History Channel, a priest in a church was talking about the people in his congregation that do not agree with his teachings, he said, "If you do not agree with me and my teachings, then go join a new congregation or go down the road and build your own church." That is exactly what 2 Timothy 4:3 is saying! Proof I tell you proof!
The Theory of Evolution is not a fact. A scientific fact must be 100% correct. Failure to meet only one challenge proves the fact is wrong and therefore proving creationism right. This will prove that the Theory of Evolution fails many challenges, not simply one. And because it does, the only other option is that God is the ultimate creator. The Theory of Evolution will never become a law of science because it is wrought with errors. This is why it is a theory.
The process of natural selection is not an evolutionary process. The DNA in plants and animals allows selective breeding to achieve desired results. Dogs are a good example of selective breeding. The DNA in all dogs has many recessive traits. A desired trait can be produced in dogs by selecting dogs with a particular trait to produce offspring with that trait. But you don't see dogs giving birth to humans. This is the same as the "survival of the fittest" theory of the evolutionists. Many different types of dogs can be developed this way, but they can never develop a human by selectively breeding dogs. Natural selection can never extend outside of the DNA limit. DNA cannot be changed into a new species by natural selection. It's not like whenever a person is born they "receive" DNA from their parents. God gives us DNA like a computer programmer types in code. A computer programmer doesn't create programs from other programs. It's all hand written, the same as the Bible. The same process of selective breeding is done with flowers, fruits, and vegetables. New variations of the species are possible, but a new species has never been developed by science. If Evolution were true, and using a lightning bolt and a mud puddle started life, Scientists would be able to create life easily. Evolutionist fail to admit that no species has ever been proven to have evolved in any way. Evolution is simply pie-in-the-sky conjecture without scientific proof.
Genesis 1: 1-31 is perfect proof that creationism is correct, " 1 First God made heaven & earth 2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. 3 And God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. 6 And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." 7 And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. 9 And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. 10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth." And it was so. 12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. 14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. 16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, 18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. 20 And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens." 21 So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. 24 And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so. 25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth." 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth." 29 And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so. 31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day."
Genesis 2: 1-8 describes how God made man: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 3 So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation. 4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 5 when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up--for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; 6 but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground-- 7 then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being."

However, common sense tells me that the delicate life we all have today was to circumstantial to have happened at random. I suggest you watch "The Case for a Creator". Also, there was an experiment conducted with monkeys who were given computers and began to type ant random. After hours, none of the twelve monkeys had actually typed something that made legitimate sense.

If you really think about it, things that evolutionists use as proof of evolution could be disproved by simply questioning how long animals could have survived while waiting to evolve into something better.
For example, giraffes. Giraffes have specially designed hearts to pump blood up their long necks, and neck valves that prevent too much blood from going to the brain. They would have died of high blood pressure every time they bent over to drink water if they didn't have these traits. In other words, they would have died while waiting for this trait to slowly develop.

Take a look at some fossils and notice vestigial features we have today. Why are Whales mammals? or should I ask how? Make an observation than form a hypothesis.
2. This is where I question your knowledge of evolution. There is radio-active carbon dating, fossils, vestigial features, DNA, Genetics. Hundreds of thousands of scientific journal entries have been published in support of Evolution, each independent.
3. Measurable? Irrelevent. This is not needed in to be a scientific Theory. We cannot measure quarks, black wholes, anti-matter, among many other things. Stick to the scientific method.

I honestly don't know if this post is a troll.
1) "Creation" is faith-based. A religious book says it is so, and followers of that religion then take it on faith. Collecting evidence from the world is not required. This has 0 to do with science.
2) "Evolution", agree with it or not, is our current best guess at how species came into being based on evidence that has been collected. This embodies the definition of science - it is creating explanations for natural phenomenon through observation and critical thought.
If you disagree, please explain by what method you believe the theory of evolution has come to exist.",7,1,"evolution is scientific"
167,evolution,"my example is indeed of evolution. you need to read more carefully.
to say that some subjects became extinct is impossible. extinction requires the disappearance of an entire species, not just a group of a species.
this is ONE species of birds. within every species there are variations, whether it be in coloring, size, what have you. my example looked at one simple variation. the size of beaks. since the narrow beaks survive, the species still exists, which therefore can not be extinction.
evolution is commonly summed up as "only the strong survive."
allow me to clarify, there are two kinds of evolution. the most commonly thought of form is the long term form where in new species are created, example monkeys to humans. however, evolution can also be thought of on a short term scale of maybe only a few generations, where a visible trait is seen to emerge and become dominant over a weaker trait, one that will inevitably not be found in the species anymore.",7,1,"evolution is scientific"

Sources for mutations include; errors in DNA replication, errors in recombination, damage through ionizing radiation or mutagens in the environment. There are other sources that can involve insertion of viral elements into the genome. The point being that the mutations can be random but Natural Selection (crudely put.. survival of the fittest) is not random. Small changes that grant modest advantages in producing viable offspring can rapidly spread a mutant gene through a population. Sure the "theory" has some holes but those are things to examine and perhaps make changes to the theory, not discard the whole concept.",7,1,"evolution is scientific"

1606,evolution,"First, the concept of species is an artificial construct. Being the primates that we are we like to classify things into categories and hierarchies. The Linnaeus classification system was created based on observed living organisms back in the mid 1700's which were distinct groupings.
Another problem is the definition of what makes a species a species. This is a classification problem that still exists today. There are about 8 popular ones that usually cooperate together, but there are situations that it does not. The most popular of this definition is if there is natural reproductive action between the individuals of a given population.
Please look up the experiment on the speciation of fruit flies in lab.
You can not compare genetic relations like one does with family genealogy. A human with an A blood type is more related to a Chimp with an A blood type than with a Human with a B blood type, as far as that specific gene is concerned.
Part of science is to investigate relationships and patters. The fact that Chimps have the most genetic information in common with humans, as opposed to the 70ish% with mice, is very interesting.
Here is another example. You are correct in that we did not evolve from apes. We ARE apes. The Apes are classified as the family Hominidae, which we are members of.
My final point. Of all the species Chimps have the most genes in common with us. Can you guess what species have the most genes in common with chimps?
Humans.",7,1,"evolution is scientific"
513,evolution,"my DNA is only 50% similar to that of my father so no, it is not 90% similar to that of apes.
evolution is not just a theory. when you think about it, it's impossible for it NOT to happen.
- every now and then, a mutation occurs
- weak/bad mutation = animal dies
- strong/good mutation = animal lives
- animal lives to pass on DNA
- it's children retain the 'good mutation'

2) Empirical. It is based on observations, not on guesses or faith or religious texts. Show any scientist hard evidence of another theory and he will give it consideration and change his original theory. Ask a creationist to do the same.

Evolution is our best guess based on mountains of data. The data is neutral - we look at all these natural clues (see list in jhonans post), and we try to make sense of it the best we can. THAT is theory - best humanly guess based on data and experimentation.
Creationists have their best guess, "Well, a god did it". But that is not a very good guess - you just invent some massive, powerful being out of nowhere. Now you have to #1) have evidence for Creation (the event) and #2) have evidence for a Creator (the being). You make your case very, very difficult and, alas, you never provide any evidence.

Likewise evolution. If everything was created, and some species went extinct, that means they were either created imperfectly, or created without a purpose. Doesn't seem too likely from an all knowing creator. However, if species DO randomly mutate, and all the strong ones survive it makes sense.

There are two classifications:
Macro evolution (darwin) is practically unbelievable. If his theory was true, then some of the monkies that exsisted back around Egyptian empire should be humans by now.

For example, a bacteria can adopt to its environment and become immune to antibiotics, but that doesn't make it a new specie.

This quote, from Volume 1 pg. 15, exemplifies all three volumes, and is simply false. Throughout the three volumes he presents examples of how many living things are the same through "hundreds of millions of years", while overlooking countless plants and animals, one of which is humankind. Also, a species does not have to evolve, but will if the environment demands it.
Ideas many creationist may fail to understand is that not everything is fossilized, and evolution takes hundreds, if not thousands, of generations to make any small change in a species.

1842,evolution,"The Scientific Method
The benefits from science are dramatic and widespread. By using scientific principles, man has pulled back the curtain of ignorance and advanced the quality of life for millions of people. With these achievements, science justifiably deserves a good reputation.
Taking a closer look, the essence of science is the scientific method where a hypothesis is tested by experiment. That is,
1) State the question
2) Form a hypothesis
3) Do experiments
4) Interpret data and draw conclusions
5) Revise theory (go back to step 2)
Instead of endless philosophical discussions to prove a point, experiment becomes the final arbitrator of truth - a successful approach. The issue becomes a bit sticky when discussing origins. How do we test the theory of evolution? We don't have the luxury of having a miniature universe with eons of time in the corner of a laboratory.
So this leaves both evolutionists and creationists in same the boat. No absolute way to objectivity test their assertions. No eyewitnesses... Both are left to propose a model and then compare it with nature for consistency.
Notice too, that good theories are falsifiable. Now consider the theory of evolution ... How can it be proved false? What fraction of the theory of evolution is open to invalidation, some small detail, or the entire principle?

To recap: 'Gravity' is NOT a theory. It is 'observed phenomenon'. There are currently several scientific theories of how gravity works..... A 'theory' is a VERY rigidly defined term that refers to a VERY rigidly defined description of reality. A theory is NEVER the reality itself, nor does it have any pretentions of being that.

It appears to have actually been the bones of an extinct species of chimpanzee.
Human DNA is similar to an apes (and a dogs, and a cats, and a number of other mammals), but this does not constitute any proof. In fact, since evolution requires more advanced species have greater complexity, this would indicate the horse is more evolved than human (more chromosomes).
This actually highlights a problem with evidence (on both sides, I'd imagine). Individuals tend to force biases into evidence. Mammoth is good example (turns out, not woolly and had tropical food in its stomach, which kind of rules out "lived during ice age").",7,1,Creationism
2532,evolution,"Why I doubt evolution (besides, of course, my obvious worldview):
Propagation would require two identically evolved creatures (at least in advanced creatures - male and female). Genetic differences would make them incompatible mates. Besides which, genetic deviations tend to significantly impair fertility (as with Downs syndrome).
Some species could not adapt their adaptations. Here's the general idea: a fish doesn't start breathing air. If its next generation did, it would quickly die (because it was born in water were fish live, not air), so not propagate. I realize there are creatures, that do both, but captures the idea of the problem with adaptations in general (not fish specifically). This relates to a host of actual adaptations in many species.
This introduces yet a third point. Why adapt anyway? What motivates evolution? Fish don't indicate a dissatisfaction with water; they have no drive to breathe. Do they adapt to a new environment? But how could they have enough time in a new environment to propagate before they die? If such were the case then we could see many forms of evolution currently happening.

1529,evolution,"Having completed a rebuttal on the opposing side, I feel compelled to pass judgement on this debate because of something that occurred to me while I was writing it; this debate doesn't really work properly.
Evolution and Creationism are not mutually exclusive by any means. Yes, the world and everything in it may well have been created by a force outside (or beyond) the planet itself, rather than it being a random sequence of events. I myself believe that it is improbable to suggest that something as incredibly complex and interdependent as a planet capable of supporting life could have developed purely through chance.
However, now that its here (the method by which it arrived aside) does that mean that everything within it is fixed, and controlled in every aspect by the same non-worldly means that brought the world into being? Thethinker is perfectly correct when he questions (rhetorically I assume) whether or not evolution can be an agent of creation.
This debate then could lead us to (at least) four different theories to discuss:
1. The world was created by an external power, and everything within it is controlled by an external power; there is no such thing as evolution (akin to an 'intelligent design' argument).
2. The world was created with evolution built in - the natural evolution we experience is in fact how external creationary influence functions.
3. The world was created by an external power, and left rolling - evolution happens by chance and without design.
4. The world, evolution and everything else in the world came about by chance and there is no external influence.
Now, personally I'm a believer in argument 3.

and the only true counterargument to 'Creation is true' is argument 4. We have two spare arguments that fit into both boxes.

1529,evolution,""I should have said "which deserves more credence" or "which is a more conclusive theory" or something like that."
Ah - now this is an interesting question!
Interesting mostly in the sense that the two theories are based of a widely separate degree of evidence - evolution is a theory based on observational data, whilst creationism is based on the lack of measurable data.
In a sense, this in itself provides us with an academically acceptable answer when Occam's Razor is applied. For observational data to be accepted as testament truth (pun intended) then we must make an array of assumptions; that data is gathered correctly, that it was interpreted in an unbiased manner, that hereditary characteristics and genetics in general function in the way we believe them to, etc... Compare this to the foundations of a 'creationism' theory thus;
Either the world was created by an outside influence, or it was not.
Things cannot bring themselves into existence.
We must assume that with lack of evidence to suggest that the universe could have brought itself into existence, something outside the world carried out the process.
Note, in particular, the idea that 'things cannot bring themselves into existence' - this is based almost purely on Aristotle's 4 causes, which dictates that the process that brings something into being (the efficient cause) cannot be the same thing as the substance it is made of, the form it takes or its purpose for which it came into being (these being the other three causes). Since these four causes together are the only influences that can bring something into existence, it seems the only option left to us is that the world cannot have been created under its own volition, and thus there must have been an outside influence.
The application of Occam's Razor then; in order to accept the idea of evolution we must make a great number of assumptions (as has been discussed) but for creation only one (that of the efficacy of Aristotle's logical reasoning). Since the razor requires that when evidence cannot decide the superior theory alone (and as I have written at great length, it is impossible to do so in this case) the theory requiring the least number of assumptions is preferable, we must declare Creationism the winner, if only by the laws of academic logic.
I stress that this is certainly not the only way of approaching the problem, and by no means a conclusive argument - merely the first one that occurred to me.",7,1,Creationism
2532,evolution,"When I talk about identically evolved creatures, I mean in a significant addition to the genetic material. The types of changes evolution suggests could only be maintained by two creatures with the same genetic design. Otherwise, we'd all be genetically "backward compatible".
While your explanation of natural selection was nice, I think you may have entirely missed my point on the matter of motivation. Fish live in water. There is not reason for them to be on land (no advantage). In fact for a fish to breathe air is detrimental (fish dies). So not only does natural selection not apply, it argues that said fish would not evolve because the "evolved" creature could not survive its environment. The water going fish has the advantage (it doesn't die).
Fish, by the way, are only my means of illustrating the problem (so I wasn't highlight a flaw). There are many, many creatures whose survival hinges on particular biologies or behaviors (adaptations in evolution-speak). The problem is that said adaptation could not be adapted because said creature needs it to survive anyway.",7,1,Creationism
1529,evolution,""DOES NOT say that IT is TRUE."
I don't believe I claimed it was - I hope that by alluding to the level of assumptions that must be made for it to be accepted as truth (or, okay, to be acknowledged as the most likely situation based on current evidence) I implied that it's efficacy was entirely baseless when compared to the quasi-mathematical truth that is logic.
"DOES NOT claim that the driving mechanism of change is random chance."
In this statement, you are right, the process of natural selection is not random chance. However, what I was doing when using that statement was trying to rebut the argument of someone who seemed to be under the impression that there was a concious decision made somewhere (by the creatures themselves possibly?) to change in a way that made them more suitable for a different environment. I was making the point that variation between individual organisms is random - your eye colour, hair height etc are not based on natural selection as compared to your parents (direct ancestry), merely by chance. If it makes you more suited to your environment than the next man, that is also chance. We call this combination of coincidences 'natural selection', and together they form a process that is predictable and logically acceptable, not random. But the truth is that the variation and situation that causes natural selection to occur is entirely random. The driving change of adaption and evolution is not random, but the events that allow adaption to occur are.
"DOES NOT claim that humans have evolved FROM apes."
That's true. But of course, I can only be seen to have claimed that this wasn't the case if you assume that I was using the word 'human' to mean 'not an ape'. 'Human' is a type of ape, which evolved from another type of ape, which evolved from another type of ape... Actually that's misleading, rather it's a continuous line of 'ape' without being able to pinpoint 'this is one kind' and 'this another'; they're all very slightly different. 'Human' just happens to be the name that we apply to this kind of ape which we categorise by a particular set of rules, in the same sense that 'ape' is just the name we give to a certain type of mammal because it fits another, slightly less specific set of rules.
"it is misguided to think that 'creationism' (fundamentalist, few K years old-Earth version) is an accurate description"
I agree, but this alone is not an effective argument against 'creationism' in general. Also, the fact that evolution is a more readily observable in fact weakens it's credibility, as expressed in my previous argument.

I'm not going to bother with anything except Phillip Johnson, since the other arguments have been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked elsewhere.
"...it is not even consistent with the evidence once the naturalistic spectacles are removed." Think for just one second about what that's saying. Johnson is admitting that evolution IS consistent with the evidence, but only as long as that evidence is considered in non-supernatural terms. In other words, you have to invoke the supernatural to poke holes in evolution.
Since science explicitly repudiates the supernatural, that's game, set, match for evolution as a scientific theory.

It is an algebraic x that refers to the force that is driving evolution. More importantly though, the x factor refers to what is making these animals "need" to change and then thusly transform. This force could be called "mother nature" or "god." Considering that those two forces have no place in the theory, another major fail. Here is the third and most important major fail:
The theory of evolution says that animals transform or gradually change over time because of a "need" or "ability" to sruvive. Mathemetically speaking, Humans are the only species that change over time because they feel they need to. You cant "need" something unless you are conscious, because needing is a sensation that is acted upon. Humans have the ability to accept or deny a need, totally unique to them.

There's a difference of opinion about how important this debate [advocating intelligent design] is. What I always say is that it's not just scientific theory. The question is best understood as: Is God real or imaginary? (Phillip Johnson, "The Search for Intelligent Design in the Universe", Silicon Valley Magazine, 9 Jan. 2000.)
"We are taking an intuition most people have [the belief in God] and making it a scientific and academic enterprise. We are removing the most important cultural roadblock to accepting the role of God as creator. (Phillip Johnson, "Enlisting Science to Find the Fingerprints of a Creator", LA Times, 25 Mar. 2001.)
Our strategy has been to change the subject a bit so that we can get the issue of intelligent design, which really means the reality of God, before the academic world and into the schools (P. Johnson 2003).
"Father's words, my studies, and my prayers convinced me that I should devote my life to destroying Darwinism, just as many of my fellow Unificationists had already devoted their lives to destroying Marxism. When Father chose me (along with about a dozen other seminary graduates) to enter a Ph.D. program in 1978, I welcomed the opportunity to prepare myself for battle (J. Wells n.d.).
If we take seriously the word-flesh Christology of Chalcedon (i.e. the doctrine that Christ is fully human and fully divine) and view Christ as the telos toward which God is drawing the whole of creation, then any view of the sciences that leaves Christ out of the picture must be seen as fundamentally deficient. (William Dembski, Intelligent Design: The Bridge Between Science & Theology, Downers Grove, InterVarsity Press, 1999.)
"Intelligent design is just the Logos theology of John's Gospel restated in the idiom of information theory (Dembski 1999, 84).
Johnson said he and most others in the intelligent design movement believe the designer is the God of the Bible (Maynard 2001).",7,1,Evolution
1189,evolution,"1) It is hard to understand how anyone could make this claim, since anything mutations can do, mutations can undo. Some mutations add information to a genome; some subtract it. Creationists get by with this claim only by leaving the term "information" undefined, impossibly vague, or constantly shifting. By any reasonable definition, increases in information have been observed to evolve. We have observed the evolution of
* increased genetic variety in a population (Lenski 1995; Lenski et al. 1991)
* increased genetic material (Alves et al. 2001; Brown et al. 1998; Hughes and Friedman 2003; Lynch and Conery 2000; Ohta 2003)
* novel genetic material (Knox et al. 1996; Park et al. 1996)
* novel genetically-regulated abilities (Prijambada et al. 1995)
If these do not qualify as information, then nothing about information is relevant to evolution in the first place.
2) A mechanism that is likely to be particularly common for adding information is gene duplication, in which a long stretch of DNA is copied, followed by point mutations that change one or both of the copies. Genetic sequencing has revealed several instances in which this is likely the origin of some proteins. For example:
* Two enzymes in the histidine biosynthesis pathway that are barrel-shaped, structural and sequence evidence suggests, were formed via gene duplication and fusion of two half-barrel ancestors (Lang et al. 2000).
* RNASE1, a gene for a pancreatic enzyme, was duplicated, and in langur monkeys one of the copies mutated into RNASE1B, which works better in the more acidic small intestine of the langur. (Zhang et al. 2002)
* Yeast was put in a medium with very little sugar. After 450 generations, hexose transport genes had duplicated several times, and some of the duplicated versions had mutated further. (Brown et al. 1998)
The biological literature is full of additional examples. A PubMed search (at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi) on "gene duplication" gives more than 3000 references.
3) According to Shannon-Weaver information theory, random noise maximizes information. This is not just playing word games. The random variation that mutations add to populations is the variation on which selection acts. Mutation alone will not cause adaptive evolution, but by eliminating nonadaptive variation, natural selection communicates information about the environment to the organism so that the organism becomes better adapted to it. Natural selection is the process by which information about the environment is transferred to an organism's genome and thus to the organism (Adami et al. 2000).
4) The process of mutation and selection is observed to increase information and complexity in simulations (Adami et al. 2000; Schneider 2000).

3804,evolution,"In my opinion the whole debate seems rather idiotic. Let's assume that evolution is true in the belief that it all started with "The Big Bang." Essentially this means that there was a tiny, highly dense ball that exploded and started this awesome chain reaction. Let's stop right there and just debate that much. Forget genetic evolution, fossil findings ect. The debate never needs to go that far. I assume that we can all agree according to any scientific view everything has a lifespan, ie a beggining and an end. Such as protons, nutrons, all physical things and the universe. Do we all agree on this? ok, now I think we can all agree that according to even the most basic science nothing+nothing=nothing Ok so what's the point right? Well since everything has a to come from something and has to have a beginning, this super tiny, dense ball could not have just been floating in space for all eternity because we agreed that's not possible, and this ball could not have just came into existence from nothing, because that too is impossible. So even if you just take the theory a far as the tiny, dense ball of matter there is no possible way to get around the fact that something that stands outside of space/time, something eternal, ie GOD, had to have created it. You say "But that's not scientific and takes a leap of faith" and I will tell you that all other answers go against all scientific data at the most basic level on up and take a much bigger leap of faith to believe since I just proved they are all scientificaly impossible.",7,1,Evolution
600,evolution,"Everyone is like, "Evolution doesn't explain how we all began!!!". It's not supposed to, that is not the purpose of the theory of evolution. Evolution, the word, by definition means "change over time". The theory of evolution has nothing to do with the big bang, or how everything started in the galaxy, evolution is just really a simple concept. It's the concept of how natural organism change over time on earth, not how they got here, or began. I mean, I know a lot about evolution, and that's the main argument, people just don't understand that evolution isn't an answer to the beginning. Also, evolution is a scientific theory. A scientific theory is one that has been backed up my year and years, and thousands upon thousands of scientific information that only leads in one direction. For instance, gravity. Gravity is only a theory, we have proof that it currently exists, do we know why it exists? No exactly, but we have a pretty close answer, but it is only a theory because it could one day change. Just like evolution, we have information that only point towards it, not against it, but it could change one day, and we don't know that. There is a difference between a fact and a theory, 2+2=4, that's a fact, that will never change. gravity and evolution is a theory, it could very well one day change. People who believe in evolution are not trying to shut down people who believe in creationism, evolution is just a scientific statement of change over time. that's all.",7,1,Evolution
600,evolution,"Actually, it is proven that dinosaurs and birds, two completely different species are related and have changed through adaptation. Keep in mind, this isn't an over night change, it takes milions upon milions upon millions of year to occur. Think about bats. Bats are mammals. They have fur, they birth like any other mammals, no eggs involved. We are very much genetically related to bats, yet they fly like birds? Why? adaptation to environemental change, something that takes a LONG time to occur, but occurs none the less. Now dinosaurs, they are reptiles, how could they become birds? It's called homologous structures. Through bone sturctures, organs, muscles, and other important factors, organisms can be related to each other through common anscestory. For example, why do birds have wings?And why do we have arms? how do birds have legs? how do we have legs? How do birds have heads? how do we have heads? birds have eyes, we have eyes. Why do we share so much in common with so many organisms? The only explanation is the derivation of a common anscetor milllions of years ago that head a head, had arms or wings, had legs, had eyes. The structure of the bones within a bird, whale, human, are almost completely similar structures as far as the compostition on the bone is concerned. And then, we have to keep in mind of etymological relations. If you look at a human fetus, whale fetus, bird fetus in the first few months and weeks of like, there is almost no difference in structure or the way they look, theya ctually look almost the same. I implore you to look at this. Why? Coincidence? I'm afraid not, the beauty of change over time!",7,1,Evolution
600,evolution,"We cannot say that micro-evolution occurs but that macro-evolution does not. It is false to say that the changes that occur at the microscopic level in our bodies or in the bodies of any organism does not have a lasting effect at the macroscopic level. Take DNA. Good ol' Deoxyribosenucleic acid. Now, DNA is constantly going through mutations. 1 in every 10,000 base pairs in the DNA strand of a homo-sapian is mutated, whether that part of the strand is deleted, inserted, flipped, it happens. Okay, when we reproduce, chromosomes (build-ups/thick clumps of DNA and tertiary protein bonds) are mixed between the male and female. It's called Meiosis. So say, the mother's DNA codes for long hair, and the fathers DNA strand genetically codes for curly hair. When their chromosomes go through meiosis, and the alleles cross-over onto each others, the base pairs mix together. That's why if a mother with straight hair, and a father with curly have a kid, the kid has wavy hair. that is an example of how DNA changes at the microscopic level and have a macroscopic effect. This kid with wavy hair will then pass down his genetic material and mix it with someone else, and it will go on and on, and the pool of gentic codes will constantly be changed and over millions of years, that generation will have been completely changed. And isn't that the definition of evolution. a change over time.",7,1,Evolution

1068,evolution,""Neither evolution nor intelligent design have been proven right or wrong. Therefor, why only reach one of them?!?"
Because ID is a catchall theory. It says, "We don't know how this happened, so something beyond science caused it, so we might as well stop looking." Anything new that we can't explain gets chalked up to, "Well, that's just part of the ID we'll never be able to understand." It closes the question.
If, on the other hand, a new fact seems to contradict evolution, science has to go to work. Explain it, refute it, incorporate it, or throw out evolution entirely because of it: the theory must adapt to the facts. That's what makes it science.
It's comforting to have catchalls; psychology has a lot of them. Someone starts sleeping 18 hours a day, you can just call them depressed; a kid's getting lousy grades you can call it ADD. Except that we know that those are diagnoses of last resort, and so first you have to do the work. You run medical tests, you investigate lifestyle factors, you check for inherited issues or environmental contributions. You check everything that can be disproved before you attach a label that can't be disproved; that's how science is supposed to function.

3868,evolution,"Intelligent design MUST not be taught. First, let us define our terms;
A theory is "an explanation of concept/idea that is supported by evidence and/or many experiments/trials and is widely accepted by the scientific community."
So yes, evolution is absolutely a theory, yet it is present to have some sort of negative connotation. Gravity is still a theory, as there is instances in time and spaces where its effects vary (such as in the case of dark matter.) This does not therefore imply that gravity does not exist consistently on the planet earth, merely that it's effects are, perhaps, not always consistent in every instance and therefore it is possible that it can never be a law.
On the other hand, intelligent design is NOT a theory because it is not scientific. Whereas evolution is a conclusion based on a collection of observations, ID is a conclusion that uses observations to support it. This flies in the face of the scientific process. You are taking the word of the bible, in itself unscientific, and drawing a conclusion from it. From there you collect instances in nature that fit this conclusion and ignore those that do not. This is not scientific.
This is not to say, however, that there is not God and that, assuming there is, He played no role in our creation. I find it entirely plausible that God started the chain of events that brought us to where we are today. I, however, do not believe he played any role whatsoever after the Big Bang, and evolution tells us that he did not. I have no disputes with your, or any other, God, merely with ID's hijacking of science for the purpose of projecting religion onto subjects where it does not belong.
Such is the irrefutable, undeniable and inescapable reasoning as to why Intelligent Design does not and cannot belong in the scientific classroom; because it, by definition, is not science.

It will never be 'proven' because there are gaps in the scientific evidence caused by a loss of fossils and the like, not because there is evidence to the contrary.

We do not teach grammar in a science class for the same reason...it just does not fit.
Schools are not present to change or form any ideas on religion at all. Schools are present to teach students the facts as we know them. Teaching religion or how the human race came to be is left up to your parents and/or family members.
The difference between science and ID is that the science taught in the classroom has been substantiated with information we have actually seen or properly documented.
Lastly...if we started teaching ID in science...we would have to also add classes for all other possible "ideas" regarding the creation of man kind.",7,1,"ID should NOT be taught."
915,evolution,"No, because while ID uses some possibly legitimate scientific facts, the essence of the "theory" is anti-scientific. It is a thinly disguised attempt to insert the insidious force of theology into an arena in which it should never be allowed to intrude. Science is based on radical open-mindedness, combined with radical skepticism. It is clear to any intellectually honest person that ID has the very opposite characteristics. If there somehow were evidence of a creator God, uh, I mean, intelligent designer, then the scientific community would definitely accept it. Think of the original Darwinian, Charles Darwin himself. When faced with unambiguous evidence, he admitted that it called for an entirely new paradigm, despite the personal pain caused by the loss of his religious belief. The same would occur if scientists were to somehow see evidence for the opposing perspective.
Religious thinking is inherently nihilistic, by which I mean that it embraces a cheap relativism, which says that all views are equally legitimate, regardless of what the evidence says. These nihilists do not believe in the human mind or in evidence from our five senses. It believes that humanity and the human world is marked only by folly and ignorance. To illustrate my point, and the degree to which ID theorists are distrustful of the very basis of science, you should watch the ID debate on Youtube (the one with William F. Buckley). Toward the end, David Berlinski makes a very telling statement, to the effect that everything is an illusion. I apologize for not having the specific quote, but if one watches the debate, they will certainly notice what I am talking about. Berlinski is a scientist, who is fully aware of the ability of the human mind to comprehend the world around it, by the use of reason, that uniquely human faculty. Because of this nihilism, religious people believe that in this world of ignorance and folly, it is permissible to use any and every means to achieve one's goal. Because they do not see the deep honesty of science, instead considering it merely the current mantle of legitimacy, they see no problem with using the brilliantly cunning scheme of intelligent design to establish what they believe to be the truth, the only ray of light to enter into the darkness of the cave.",7,1,"ID should NOT be taught."
3868,evolution,"Utterly false. Evolution conforms to a rigid scientific process involving observing animals, especially their physical and biological traits and determining exactly what their linage was through time. Intelligent Design, although I do not discount its credibility *outside the scientific realm*, it is essentially supplementing a preconceived notion in lieu of an actual conclusion. I'm very curious to know about these 'experiments' and 'testable conclusions.' You would think that a scientific experiment proving the existence of God would be more publicized.
The Bible has everything to do with the intelligent design movement. Saying otherwise is merely a tactic used by the (admittedly more progressive) ID believers who wish to remove themselves from fundamentalist Christians thumping on this concept. It is the basis of the conclusion that drives ID believers. I sincerely doubt you'll be looking into the Qu'ran. I have large doubts that the Bible just happens to coincide with what you believe. The similarities with the arguments for ID and the writings in Gensis are just a huge coincidence?
My arguments are not anti-God, anti-theist or anti-Christian. I am merely saying that all modern science strongly suggests that the only celestial being that had a impact on the earth was an asteroid. If you believe God spawned the universe with his infinite wisdom; so be it. I merely ask that you do not try to belittle the scientific process with your religious predispositions.",7,1,"ID should NOT be taught."

3868,evolution,"This is an incredibly blind view. Fossils are universally recognized as strong evidence for the process of evolution.

Even so, we know which fossils are full and which are not by what can be seen and what is not present. Furthermore, scientists often discover several fossils from the same animal, therefore are able to fill in the blanks.
You treat these scientists like they're a bunch of fourth graders diggin up rocks. These are highly trained paleontologists who dedicated their lives to knowing what they're talking about. For you to sit there and say that fossils don't prove anything because they're not evidence is obvious disingenuous and fundamentally void of facts or logic.
Say you have twenty fossils from what is obviously the same animal, each one can be carbon dated to be 100,000 years away from the previous and each one contains one or more small change from the previous.

Contrary to what is taught in the schools, the advancement of science shows that the origins of life could not have possibly been thrown together at random millions of years ago, ultimately bringing forth life from a soup that evolved through the years. The more evidence uncovered shows that there indeed was a beginning. The question then is, was the universe created by its own accord, or is there an intelligent being that created the universe and the life found within it?
I look forward to hearing from some of you to see what kind of information may be brought to the table.",7,1,Creationism
3214,evolution,"There are two ways to look at this deabte.
1. Metaphysical. In which case it's the question of whether or not God (or some other being) purposfully controls the events of creation.
2. Scientifically. In which case it's a question of whether or not the universe suddenly just appeared or....acutally Creationism and the Big Bang are relatively similar. Everything is just kind of there all of a sudden.
I tend to think that everything just poofed into existance for a reason and (ironically) creationism is the only side that explains the poofing.Creationism's Metaphysical answer seems to fit better with the agreed upon scientific answer. IMO.",7,1,Creationism
4094,evolution,"Apathetic – I agree with Rationalist. It’s hard to see what side you’re on. First off, let’s not make the mistake of separating the metaphysical hypothesis from the scientific hypothesis. After all, if it were to be discovered that oh, let’s say a slice of cheese caused the universe to be in existence, then that would be considered science. Even if the earth did just “poof” into existence, there is still a science to it, just like there is a science to a simple blink of an eye.
It seems, Rationalist, that the big bang theory came about due to part that science can trace events back in time only to a certain point. At that point, there is a barrier that cannot be pushed. Far from supporting the naturalism, big bang theory says that there is a limit to how far back the earth’s origins go, proving that time, space, and matter were created at a finite point in time. So, it is not contrary to believe in both the big bang and creationism. It is simply the same idea being sold under two different labels.
Scarleta – Wonderful observation. Supposing we take up the idea that there is a finite beginning to our universe, then that means something from outside our universe had to do with it coming into existence. So let’s use your example that God is the source from outside our universe and that he spoke it into existence. The idea that God must have a beginning seems logical. But let’s say we discover that God did have a beginning, and that we found God’s creator. Then what question would we have to ask? Who created God’s creator! And back and back and back and back we go. Even our great grandchildren wouldn’t live to see the results. But suppose time, space and matter were created by one being. Think about it… time: created. Time assembled and put together like a clock itself. What’s outside of time? Nothing. And certainly not time. In order to create something, you must be outside its element. Therefore, God would not be constricted to the laws of time. This makes Him eternal. And what about space? The place in which we move around, drive, fly, spin, and jump? What if that whole concept was created as well? If God created space (including outer space), he would not be limited to certain locations or pinpointed on a GPS because He could hold space in his hand as if I were to hold a seashell. This would make God omnipresent. And matter? Nothing’s the matter to a God who could assemble atoms together and construct the intricacies of DNA molecules. So as for the poofing not being a valid explanation for the beginning of the universe, or at least not to consider it, makes no sense to me. I think it’s every bit as valid as any other theory. The only question is, which theory makes the most sense and holds up the most weight in the end? As for the big bang, like I told Rationalist, it certainly gives proof to creationism, but the theory tries to avoid the idea of a creator.
Jonjax71 – To my memory, the exploding/expanding idea was first introduced (or at least made popular) by a man named Carl Sagan in his science program called Cosmos. He suggested that the explosion that caused our universe was only one in a series – that the universe is expanding today but will one day reverse itself and will begin a process of contracting until it is once again a tiny point, then it will explode again, starting the entire process over, like an accordion opening and closing. But this runs up against one of the basic laws of physics: Even an oscillating universe would use up the available energy in each cycle, and it would eventually run down. The second law of thermodynamics, the law of decay, shoots down any notion of an eternal universe.",7,1,Creationism
136,evolution,"I never got the whole "Video Blog" thing. It always seems to me like its a venue to be arrogant with shades of egotism (but thats just me).
I do find it interesting that you are so readily willing to accept "The Big Bang produced both SPACE and TIME. There was NOTHING outside the big bang and there was NOTHING before it either."
This is interesting because accepting that quote from your "Vlog" (or whatever they call it nowadays) brings about the exact same philosophical consequences as creationism does. Its the same old tired rebuttal, "If God created the Universe, then what created God?". Well if you dont believe in God how is it that you can say there was NOTHING before the big bang? What created all of the things in your balloon? I personally accept the idea that there are things that have always been and always will be, things without a beginning and an end. I'm just confused because It seems to me that you are not against the notion of things "poofing" into existence, but you are against it when anyone suggests there may have been a "poofer" (one who does the poofing) which is totally contradictory to your quote.",7,1,Creationism
2808,evolution,"To the contrary! The Big Bang has only half cooked theories and complicated explanations which really make no sense. For example, the formation of man is suggested to be a process called 'abiogenesis', which is a largely improbably formation of living cell matter from inanimate matter. It makes more logical sense for us all to be created. Remember, the human being is complex - even more complex than a chimpanzee. The world and animals are made entirely differently - how could each one be different if we were all created by the same ameoba? Why weren't some animals bypassed to get directly to us? How'd they all form with nary a one being missed? There's so many holes in Evolution that I don't see how 'proof' could be provided.",7,1,Creationism

136,evolution,""There is no "poof" in the big bang."
Fully ware of this. The "poof" was just a metaphor. I could have also said something like "What lit the wick that was the creation of the universe?"
"The "no time before the big bang" position is not philosophical. It is a matter of mathematics"
Not true. There are plenty of courses at even the most basic Universities and Community colleges that discuss the real life consequences of various mathematical theories and proofs to prove my point.
"So the question, "what happened before the big bang?" is meaningless on more than one level. (a) we have no way of knowing, (b) the mathematics says that time itself didn't exist before the big bang, and (c) it's not clear that the question actually makes sense in the first place."
(a) Surely out of curiosity alone, something as important and mind blowing as the beginning of existence would be one of the most meaningful things ever right? It is also very strange to hear "We have no way of knowing" from so many athiests. To me it just seems like an excuse, an attempted shortcut. "What made the Universe and how was it done? Well we'll most likely never know so dont even worry your pretty little head about it". For someone who places so much value in science (as well you should) it seems very contradictory to think that way. Humanity should be (and is) constantly learning about anything and everything within our universe, saying "we have no way of knowing" is cutting our species way short.
(b) and (c) I was actually going to write a rebuttal to this but i realized that i agree with you. Time and Space are limitations within our universe so (and this is where the Theism comes in) couldn't it be said that something, "God" will call it, that created the universe and all of its "things" and put them into a system that is constantly expanding and contracting would BY DEFINITION have to exist outside of that system and not be bound my the laws of space and time? I know thats a loaded question and brings about a plethora of other questions to go along with it, but i'll ask it nonetheless.
-----------------------------------------
I'd just like to thank you DKTurner for FINALLY giving me the chance to have an intelligent and respectable discussion about God. You're using arguments that i rarely see and you're doing it in a way that puts neither of us on the defensive. THESE are the kinds of discussions that i would love to see.

1485,evolution,"I believe in young earth creationism. Anything that exists in time had to have had a beginning. Anything that begins to exist has a cause. If there is a car accident that begins, everybody knows that the accident had a cause. Since we know that everything has a beginning and everything that begins has a cause, there could be only two things that could have caused it to happen. They are either personal things or impersonal things. Impersonal things are something like earthquakes, tornadoes, or anything that causes destruction. Since we have life, we know that the cause wasn't impersonal, so it to have been a personal cause. Someone had to have created this Universe.
This doesn't prove Christianity (even though I am a Christian) but it does show there had to have been a creator who created the Universe.",7,1,Creationism
1485,evolution,"Please give me some examples of science supporting macro evolution. There are evidence of micro evolution. We always see species change within their kind. People breed dogs and ended up getting other dogs like chiwawas, but it's still the same specie(a dog). Macro evolution however is the change from one kind of animal to another. An example is a dag changing into a non dog, like a bird or cat. So when you say science proves evolution, which evolution are you talking about, and if it is macro evolution you are talking about, then show me some of the scientific examples that you say prove it.",7,1,Creationism
1485,evolution,"First off, none of them give me any proof that these bones/species are our ancestors, and how can they tell how old these bones are? They're just bones they find in the dirt.
Also, I said that everything that exists in time has to have a beginning. God is outside of time. And the fact that the Universe has not reached equilibrium yet proves that the Universe had a beginning. And your Big Bang theory, where did the dirt come from? Also, the big bang was a ball of dirt spinning faster and faster and finally exploded. The pieces of course flew off and became the galaxies, stars, etc. If the ball was spinning counter-clockwise, then shouldn't the pieces flown off also be spinning counter-clockwise? If that is so, then why is Venus, Neptune's moon, and other planets and moons out there spin clockwise? Which is backwards from all the other planets. All the planets, moons, stars, and galaxies have to be spinning the same direction if the Big Bang was true.",7,1,Creationism
1485,evolution,"You tell me to look up these fossils, molecular biology, etc, and say these prove evolution, but these aren't proof for evolution at all. I will now give you evidence that evolution can't be true.
1. I'll start off by talking about fossils. First of all, if evolution is true, then we shouldn't have any trouble finding these missing link fossils. In over millions of year there should be millions of missing link fossils, but there isn't. Darwin himself even stated that. Once in a great while though, scientists will say they found a missing link. The assumptions they make of course when they find these rare fossils are that the bones did not get distorted, and the animal or human wasn't originally born distorted. But even after all this time, there are still no fossils records that prove evolution. David Raup is a scientist who has a huge fossil collection admits that there are no fossil records for evolution. Dr. Colin Paterson is another scientist that wrote an evolution book called "Darwin's Enigma". He didn't give any fossil record proof in his book and later on stated that there are no fossil record for evolution. There are other evolution scientists that admit there are no fossil records for evolution: Dr. D. Berlinski, Dr. Stephen J. Gould, etc. Remember that these scientists I just mentioned are looking for missing links, and have a huge collection of fossils. Over millions of fossils.
Biology itself isn't proof for evolution. According to the evolution scientists the chimpanzee is our closest relative. The genetic difference between a human and a chimpanzee is only 1.6%. So it is 98.4% the same as a human. Although 1.6% difference may seam small, it is really a huge difference. The gap in 1.6% is 48,000,000 nucleotides. According to science a change of 3 nucleotides is fatal to any kind of animal or human. So a chimpanzee couldn't have evolved in a time of millions of years, otherwise it would have died. Saying that we are ancestors to any kind of monkey or ape because we are so similar to them is just as ridiculous as this; clouds are 100% water, watermelons are 97% water, and jellyfish are 98% water. Since they are so similar, they are each others ancestors and are related to each other. This is plain and simply ridiculous.
Another scientific example that proves evolution can't be true is the bacterium flagellum. Evolution says that we all evolved from bacteria. Without bacteria we could not live. The bacterium flagellum motor is the motor on a bacteria that enables it to be able to move around and get from place to place. Irreducible Complexity is a term used to explain a machine so complex that if you take one thing away from it, the entire machine doesn't work. An example is a mouse trap or a car motor. If you take one thing away from mouse trap like the hammer, or piston from a car motor, the entire thing doesn't work. You need all the things at one time in order for them to work. This is the same with the bacterium flagellum motor. If you take one thing away from it then the entire thing doesn't work. You need all the parts at one time in order for it to work. This shows it couldn't have evolved in over millions of years, otherwise the motor would not work and the bacteria would die. In this case, all life would not exist.
Carbon dating along with radiometric dating do not work. Scientists dated two parts of one mammoth, and both of them turned out to be different ages. One part of the mammoth turned out to be over 15,000 years old while another part of the same mammoth turned out to be over 21,000 years old. This of course isn't true. Living mollusk shells have been carbon dated to be 2300 years old. Another freshly killed seal was carbon dated to be 1300 years old. Even a living snail was carbon dated to be 27,000 years old. All of these of course can't be true.
2. What I meant by "God is outside of time" is that God is not bound by time. He himself invented time, but is intricately involved with his creation. It is impossible for me to prove this to you unless you have an open mind or your already a Christian.
3. Now, I'll first give you an example first and then explain it to you. If I left a hot cup of coffee in a room, it will eventually become the temp. of the room. This is called equilibrium. The stars, the moon, the planets, etc. are all still different temperatures. Some are hotter than others. If the universe didn't have a beginning, then everything would be the same temp. as the room it's in(universe). Yes, the star and planets have fuel to keep them hot, but the fuel will run out eventually. This is just to prove that the universe did have a beginning.
4. First off, my school doesn't even allow me to use wikipedia as a site to search for any of my projects because some of the information in wikipedia is false. Anyone can write some kind of information in it. But there are text books out there that say the big bang was a gathering of all the matter in the universe into a ball and exploded. The universe from there began to expand. Some text books are "Prentice Hall General Science" and "Prentice Hall Earth Science".
5. I forgot to ask you this question in my last post. Thanks for reminding me. So where did the energy come from?
6. As for Venus, do you know what it will take to reverse the spin of a planet? Whatever hit it must have been large enough to completely destroy it. It should have at least left some kind of marking or dent, but Venus is a perfectly round planet.
7. The arguments I come up with are legit arguments that question the evolution theory. al to an animal",7,1,Creationism
1485,evolution,"Your arrogance blinds you to the truth. I'm not going to make a huge essay like my last post, so I'll just say all I have to say in a shorter simpler essay.
First, I looked up Ken Miller on youtube and his argument of these things being able to function separately from each other is a good theory. I wouldn't doubt it at all if they can function without each other. But, you still need all the parts of the motor at one time, in their proper alignment for the motor itself to work. Ken Miller himself stated in the video that though the parts of the flagellum are functional on their own, it's still not a flagellum unless they are all together in their proper places. Otherwise the bacteria again will just sit there and die.
Now I am assuming you understand how carbon dating works, so I won't bother explaining it, but right now I can show you that carbon dating proves the earth is less than 30,000 years old. We know that carbon14 comes in the atmosphere at the same time carbon14 is leaking out of the atmosphere. The thing that scientists tried to figure out was how long will it take for the earth to reach equilibrium. In other words, how long will it take for a new born earth to receive the same amount of carbon14 as it is losing carbon14? After a while they calculated that a new born earth will reach equilibrium in about 30,000 years. If evolution is true and the earth is over billions of years old, then we should have reached equilibrium billions of years ago. But, radioactive carbon is still forming 28-37% faster than it is decaying, which means the earth is less than 30,000 years old.
On your 3rd point, remember I was just trying to point out the Universe had a beginning. It does not prove the the age of the Universe at all.
And even if the early matter of the universe was just hydrogen, then where did all the hydrogen come from? If I told you I believe God created everything, you would ask me "where did God come from"? But yet you don't know where the hydrogen came from. So I believe in the beginning God and you believe in the beginning Matter/hydrogen. Having a creator in control of the Universe sounds a lot more comforting. We are on a ball spinning around through space at very high speeds. In just our galaxy alone there is only about a 2% chance for life to even exist. The percentage for life to begin in the Universe is so small they cannot calculate it. If the earth goes off track just a little bit, we will all be die. It is a good thing knowing someone is in charge of this universe.
You said that Venus rebuilds its surface every few hundred thousand years. How do you know that? Has anyone had a telescope a few hundred thousand years ago to be able to examine it themselves? You cannot prove something without being able to examine it yourself.
I'm giving you statistics and science that are able to be examined and proven. You aren't giving me any good science. There is no way you can examine something that supposedly happened over hundreds of thousands of years ago, or even millions of years ago. Next time you read something that they claim happened millions of years ago, ask yourself the question "how do they know, and how did they figure that out"?",7,1,Creationism

We have literally watched new breeds of dogs and cats come into existence through artificial selection. It is one of the most glaring proofs that evolution occurs. You wouldn't see new species of cats or dogs evolve because you are not breeding TWO DIFFERENT SPECIES! When you do breed two different species that are capable of interbreeding YOU GET A NEW SPECIES! Have you ever heard OF A MULE or A LIGER?! Natural selection creates species over vast expanses of time so there is no reason to think that we should just see new species popping up left and right through natural selection. Do you actually care whether or not evolutionary theory is valid or not or do you just want to cling, like a fundamentalist, to your irrational religious beliefs? Do you just want to claim that you, who is completely ignorant of even the most basic knowledge on evolution, know more than the scientists? The Christian ones as well?!
Also, I wanted to bring up this point. Our structural imperfection is a strong proof of evolution, but if your God created us he must like watching people suffer. Take our imperfectly evolved eyes. Why is it that the jelly that fills up the eye liquefies as we age, occasionally causing the retina to tear? Then the liquid can seep into the layer underneath the retina causing retinal detachment. Is this the handy work of your God? Is arthritis and tooth decay, which caused the suffering and death of many of our early ancestors, and every other ill that mankind and animals suffer from the divine creation of your God?!

965,evolution,""Why don't you read about Creationism? Obviously you know as much about it as I do about evolution."
Incorrect. You now NOTHING about evolution. I on the other hand grew up Catholic and have read the bible. I have listened to dozens of debates where Creationists have stated their case. You have NEVER read a book or an article on the Theory of Evolution. You have no clue of what you are against and are completely ignorant. You reject it because you are a religious fundamentalist and could care less about scientific evidence.
"Christianity starts out with a major advantage - a Textbook explicitly explaining how humanity came into being."
You are delusional.
"How can you so blatantly ignore such a major part of the Bible (unless you are picking and choosing what you want to believe)"
Huh, that's funny. The irony is killing me on this one. Just like you ignore the biblical mandate to rest on the Sabbath? Just like you ignore the biblical mandate to kill those who don't believe as you do? Yes, there is a biblical mandate for that:
If you hear that in one of the towns that Yahweh your God has given you for a home, there are men, scoundrels of your own stock, who have led their fellow citizens astray, saying, "Let us go and serve other gods," hitherto unknown to you, it is your duty to look into the matter, examine it, and inquire most carefully. If it is proved and confirmed that such a hateful thing has taken place among you, you must put the inhabitants of that town to the sword; you must lay it under the curse of destruction - the town and everything in it. You must pile up all its loot in the public square and burn the town and all its loot, offering it all to Yahweh your God. It is to be a ruin for all time and never rebuilt. (Deuteronomy 13:12-16)
You don't have to take those parts of the bible literally but Collins should take the creation story literally?
"Yes, but supposing that the cat evolved from the dog again, okay?"
If you would read and learn about Evolution you wouldn't ask such idiotic questions. Go look up transitional forms and speciation.
"The human body has its flaws and capabilities. Yet, it's far better than that of any man made creation."
"Many diseases, weaknesses and flaws are actually the result of human actions."

You're right but I hate to break it to you, evolution does not happen by chance. No scientist claims this. Evolution works through natural selection which is the exact opposite of chance. Richard Dawkins clarifies this point in his book, "The blind watchmaker". Think of a monkey typing on a computer. This would be you're idea of how evolution works. Now think of a monkey typing on a computer with spell check turned on. This is more or less how evolution really works.
The complexity of living systems could never evolve by chance�they had to be designed and created.
Back again.. Now according to your logic, the complexity of life on earth could never have evolved by chance, and had to be created or designed. So God, something far more complex does not need to be created or designed?
Do you realize that we have documented studies of fish such as the "stickleback" which has adapted to new environments in the past few decades, and evolved into their own species? We've done thousands of studies on flies to show just how easily the evolve. And viruses evolve at an incredible rate. Ever wonder why they keep changing the flu shot? Its because influenza evolves! Oh but it couldn't be evolution it must be God who is tweaking its DNA. God has to keep improving his weapons on the human race, because we all know Christians never get influenza, only the sinners.

2,evolution,"I have never read a high school biology text book with a chapter devoted entirely to slamming religion.The reason for this is that scientists justify their findings on their own merit. They have no need to slam other areas like creationism. Creationism does not provide evidence to support itself so it needs to slam science in order to justify itself.
Evolution has not been cast out by scientists. Maybe it doesn't look the same as when Darwin proposed it, but that's because scientists are interested in progress and improving theories. Additionally, there is proof of evolution in the form of speciation (there is other assorted proof, but I'm not a biologist so I won't try to explain it). For instance, a new mosquito has developed that is specifically adapted to live in London metro tunnels. This insect did not previously exist (which makes sense as there were no metro tubes, before metro tubes were built).
Claiming that evolution should not be taught as it inflicts harm on and is unfair to religion is a weak argument. Evolution is not a belief system. Most developed nations are founded with freedom of religion in mind. In this vein, people are therefore guaranteed freedom to pursue no religion. Teaching creationism is akin to teaching religion. If it is taught in public schools, the children's right to freedom of religion is being violated.
Furthermore, Pope John Paul II himself is quoted as saying "In his encyclical Humani Generis (1950), my predecessor Pius XII has already affirmed that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation, provided that we do not lose sight of certain fixed points....Today, more than a half-century after the appearance of that encyclical, some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than a hypothesis. In fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers, following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines. The convergence in the results of these independent studies – which was neither planned nor sought – constitutes in itself a significant argument in favor of the theory."

Evolutionary theory is not founded on Haeckel's observations or theories. Haeckel's work was discredited in the 19th century, and has not been relevant to biology since the rediscovery of Mendel's laws of genetics. That the biogenetic law is false has been the consensus of biologists for over 100 years, and developmental biologists have been working constructively to provide alternative explanations, which have so far all been evolutionary in nature.
The similarities between vertebrate embryos are real. We must distinguish between observations of those similarities and hypotheses about their causes. The similarities are not in doubt; there are worthwhile studies of the degree and timing of the similarities, but none that question their overall existence. What Wells has described is one hypothesis about the cause, Haeckel's biogenetic law, which failed early and spectacularly. He has not addressed any modern hypotheses, nor has he provided a better alternative.
Evidence for common descent lies in the unity of form and process. We do not use Haeckel's outmoded, invalid mechanism to argue for evolution. Instead, we look at the marvelous convergence of disparate organisms on common principles: all animals use the same genes to define regions of their bodies, all vertebrates build their faces by unlikely rearrangements of odd pharyngeal protrusions, and even tailless mammals like us have to start with tailed embryos. The best explanation for these phenomena is that they are a consequence of a common heritage.

The commonly-used "survival of the fittest" shorthand for evolution is indeed tautological as it stands. That's not the definition of evolution. Evolution is the change in allele frequencies of a population due to differential rates of reproduction of the phenotypes corresponding to the set of genotypes in the pool. In no way is this definition tautological.
"There was only sand, seawater, lightning, and volcanoes to produce evolution, so we know that is what produced it. "
Statements like that make me cringe. To paraphrase Babbage, I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a statement. It's an infantile thing to say. And I guarantee you it wasn't a scientist who said it. So who's the creationist straw-man in this case?
...And you go on with another half a dozen equally infantile misconstructions of science, which are rightly easy to demolish, straw-men that they are.
"Since creationism could not possibly be true, ours wins by default." Nonsense. Utter rubbish. The actual statement is this: to demonstrate that life must have had a creator, you must show that this is the only mechanism that could have achieved the given complexity. Since you have not demonstrated that it is the only possible mechanism (evolution being a viable alternative), and since your hypothesis makes no other testable predictions, you have not advanced an argument that makes a useful contribution to our understanding of the world. In other words, creationism is useless (as Rev. Marc Leclerc said to the Discovery Institute, in explanation for why they weren't invited to the Vatican's conference on evolution).
Evolution can be falsified. It's been said many times. Find a fossil rabbit in the pre-Cambrian, and you've blown evolution out of the water. That's all you have to do. Maybe you should be out there digging instead of in here misquoting?

337,evolution,"Evolution by analogy:
A living creature's genes are like a set of blueprints that are used to build the creature. Offspring inherit roughly half of their blueprints from each parent (with some exceptions). Very occasionally a blueprint is subtly altered when it is being copied. Some blueprints are "better" than others when it comes to surviving and reproducing, e.g. longer legs make it easier to run away from predators. Statistically, we expect that over time there will be more of the better blueprints and fewer of the inferior blueprints.
Sometimes, particularly when two populations are isolated from each other, the sets of available blueprints in two populations become so different that they are incompatible, i.e. it's impossible to build a working individual from any combination of blueprints from the two sets. This is known as speciation. Once this happens, the blueprints tend to drift further apart, as no mixing occurs. Thus we end up with situations where, for example, the reptiles branched into two distinct groups, birds and mammals, which cannot breed with each other.
Over further time the distinct groups branch into further incompatible sub-groups (e.g. canines and ungulates), and then branch again and again, so that we end up with a "tree of life" - many distinct species, all of which had a common ancestor at some point, but some pairs having had a more recent common ancestor than others. For example, humans and chimps had a common ancestor about 5 million years ago, whereas our most recent common ancestor with the baboons lived about 24 million years ago.
How can it be that two populations might favor different blueprints? There are a variety of reasons for this. Consider, for example, one population living near water and another living near trees: the population near water will tend to favor blueprints that make it easier to swim, while the population near trees favors blueprints that help them to swing from the branches. This is the origin of divergent evolution. Species fit themselves into niches, and each niche imposes different requirements which lead to different genes being preferred.
There's also convergent evolution: two species with very different origins may find themselves in similar situations, so that they both evolve towards a common adaption. An example of this is the Tasmanian wolf versus the common wolf: their origins couldn't be more different, but they both moved into the stalker-predator niche in their respective territories.

I stress that while I do not believe in a god myself, and do believe that evolution is a fact, the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Even if you could prove god exists (which you can't) that would not count as proof that evolution does not.
if we define evolution simply as the change in the gene pool over time, then there are many examples of evolution that we see before our very eyes. Dog breeders breed dogs for a specific reason, whether it is to look pretty, hunt animals, round up sheep, what have you. If a dog breeder wants a dog with a shorter snout, they will breed with dogs that already have shorter snouts, so that their new dog may have the genes that makes the snout shorter. This is change in the gene pool thus evolution, albeit via artificial selection.

My understanding of this debate is that one side would be for evolution (believe that evolution is a fact) and one would be against (believe that evolution does not exist). Is this also your understanding?
You seem to freely admit that evolution does in fact occur, however your next statement is rather confusing. "All things are conjurations of perception". I think that by this you are suggesting there is no difference between thinking something is there, and that thing actually being there (at least to the person doing the thinking). Forgive me if I have misinterpreted, but I do not see what this (or really any of paragraph after the first two sentences) has to do with evolution. If I assume a direct connection, than I can only think you mean to say that evolution is there only because a number of people all gave the same perception of reality. To me this is much closer to certain religions than anything else. It could be argued that a lot of people only believe in religion because a lot of other people do. However I am not here to make that claim.
You state that "Naturally that commonisms between correlating perceptions would help us refine the reality from the imagination". (I am going to assume that by commonism you mean something that is common, and not what the word actually means) Still, I do not agree with this statement. Reality is not, as you suggest, defined by common perceptions. This implies that whoever has the most people believing in the same thing is right. To continue this line of thought- this would mean if you got most people to believe that the earth is flat, than in reality, the earth would be flat. Why not instead look at facts? Are you really suggesting that science is null and void so long as the common perception differs from it?
You go on to say that "we are unable to decipher whether others 'are', or just appear to be". I hope for your sake that you do not believe in this statement.

You state that if someone were to ask me for actual evidence, I would only be "producing evidence for adaption within already existing species". While adaption is indeed evolution, (evolution is how animals adapt to environment) I will skip this because what I believe you are actually asking here is for the 'missing link', the point at which one species evolves into another. Unless of course you would like to go all the way back to single cell organisms? Back to the links: I assure you that not all these links are missing. Intermediates between animals do exist (in fossil form), in fact it could be said that any fossil is an intermediate between something and something else. This debate is about whether or not evolution occurs, correct? There is hard scientific proof that evolution does occur. You can't escape this. And if you really think you can, I would be very interested to know how.
"Evolution is a philosophical imperative for a world that rejects the idea of having to answer to god. This is simply not true. As I believe I have already stated the two (the existence of god and the fact of evolution) do not have to be mutually exclusive. I admit that most religions do not allow for evolution to be true, but it is not specifically contradictory to believe in both god and evolution.
"Actual evidence of natural processes always leads to the opposite of what 'should' be there". Please explain this statement. What do you mean by "what 'should' be there"? I am utterly perplexed by how you could explain this statement, or even think it in the first place.
I disagree wholeheartedly with your closing sentence. Nothing could be further from the truth. There IS actual, scientific, physical evidence supporting evolution. Evolution is not true because it "MUST" be true. It is true because it IS true, it has actual, credible, scientific facts to back it up. Creationists seem to repeat to themselves that there is not any evidence, they do not actually research in to it, they just chant that mantra.

Darwin's theory of evolution is indeed a theory, however evolution itself is a fact. I'm sorry if this confuses you a little, please let me explain with an apt analogy. Gravity is a fact yes? You can not deny that things which are dropped fall. Einstein's explanation of gravity however, is only a theory- one which has been replaced this century with Newton's theory of gravity, and may be replaced soon with the promising work of Erik Verlinde and his Entropy Force theory (here is a link to an article on this new theory for your convenience http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527443.800-the-entropy-force-a-new-direction-for-gravity.html ). I hope this clears things up- while Darwin's proposed theory of evolution (mainly involving the mechanisms with which evolution works) is only a theory, evolution itself is fact. Edit: I saw one of your other posts- the one saying that you don't believe animals could come from a single cell organism.

To reiterate- what is often referred to as the theory of evolution is actually the theories of the mechanisms of evolution (how evolution works, not whether it does). I have cited a few (of the many) fossils as evidence but I should explain that the fossil evidence, while very strong, is not the strongest evidence for evolution. Even if no fossils were found, evolution is still proved with DNA, molecular science, etc. I chose fossils because they are usually the easiest for people to understand and you can go see the physical evidence for yourself.

"In biology, evolution is change in the genetic material of a population of organisms through successive generations."
The key thing about these different types of evidence for evolution is how they complement each other. All these astoundingly different ways of proving evolution (which would all singularly prove evolution) interlock so perfectly, not one single peice contradicts any other. It is amazing! Take fossils for example.. how do creationists explain that not one single fossil is found in the wrong time period (the time period can be seen by, among other things, what type of rock and how far down the fossil is embedded). Out of the hundreds of thousands of different types of fossils found, none occur at the wrong time- all support evolution. How do creationists explain this? How would you? If all animals were created in the same week, than surely there would be all sorts of fossils in different time periods. I repeat- not one single fossil out of the millions found (hundreds of thousands of different types) not one is in a time period that does not complement evoltion.
Intelligent design theorists seem to be almost based solely around what you have just pointed out. They also suggest that biological organs are so complicated, how could they possible have evolved. And so I ask you, if they are so complicated how could they have been designed? Presumably the designer would have to be even more complicated. And who designed the deisgner and so on and so forth- an obvious and infinte loop. But back to the one technique you singled out: DNA. DNA is invariable across creatures but the individual genes vary. This helps to prove that all creatures came from a single ancestor. When you look at the DNA from all animals ou will find a beautiful hierarchy.. human DNA is close to chimpanees, slightly more distant from monkeys, slighlty more distant still from rat, etc. And all this fits perfectly with what evolution already suggests with other evidence. I suggest you watch the interview between Richard Dawkins and Wendy Wright you can find on YouTube. It is truely fascinating how creationists simply choose to ignore evidence, even when they could reach out and touch it.",7,1,Evolution

I assume you are actually refering to radioactive dating (carbon is not the only radioisotope used in this manner) Let me lay out the approximations of half lifes for you: (I assume you have an inkling of how carbon dating works, given your dismisal of it) Uranium 235 to Lead 207 (half-life = 710,000,000 years) Uranium 238 to Lead 206 (half-life = 4,500,000,000 years) Thorium 232 to Lead 208 (half-life = 14,000,000,000 years) Rubidium 87 to Strontium 87 (half-life = 47,000,000,000 years) Potassium 40 to Argon 40 (half-life = 1,300,000,000 years) Carbon 14 to Nitrogen 14 (half-life = 5,570 years) .. with a margin of error of 1%, how can you get 6000 years out of the 4.5 billion estimated? there is no proof to this young Earth. None. while you mentioned that you believe carbon dating to be false you didn't actually mention how you would explain why fossils are only found in particular time periods. Now let's say you are correct in saying credible science has the time period wrong. This still does not explain why the fossils are all grouped together in certain types of rock.. if all animals were created around the same time (and especially i you're of the belief that adam's sinning brought death into the world) why do the fossils contain specific groups at specific times? regardless of if the time is millions of years ago or just a few thousand. Please note there are numerous other methods that show the earth to be older than 6000 years. Now what do you mean intelligent designer? It is easy when you look at the outside of an animal to say the design is intelligent.. but how about the inside? An intelligent designer (really any designer who has the ability of foresight, but pressing on) would surely make animals in the most efficent and logical way yes? Unfortunately for intelligent design believers this is not what we see. What we see instead lines up with evolution. Let's look at the sinus passages in a human. where would you expect the drainage hole to be.. given you are intelligent (perhaps even omnipotent.. though that is arguably an inherintly contradictory word) and have foresight? (I keep bringing up foresight because this is something important that evolution does not have) You would use gravity to help out surely. The human's sinus drainage passage is on top, facing up. This gives away our ancestoral past. On four legs, this passage would be positioned at the front.. when we stood up (eventually) the passage would be on top as we see now. There are many examples of unintelligent design, I will give one more for arguments sake. The koala. The koala's pouch faces down. What! Koalas spend most there time up trees! Who in their right (and intelligent) mind would design a tree climbing mammal with a pouch facing down?? But when you go through the koala's past you can see why.. not through ID but through evolution. Koalas are decended from a wombat-like (the '-like' is very important) creature. These creatures dig alot, if they had a forward facing pouch they would be constantly shoveling dirt in to their pouch and their young. As the Koala evolved it's pouch stayed the way of its ancestor. Intriguing to say the least, and not the most provoking of examples. If time, space and matter didn't exist.. than how did god? How can he exist outside these things.. there is no such thing as existance outside these things. If he doesn't exist in space/time than in what way does he exist. The interveiw is lengthy and can get repetitive given that Wright consistently avoids facts and question during the interview. But i do recommend you watch it.

I do not dismiss creation as false because it is hard to comprehend. I dismiss it as false because there is no evidence.

Firstly I would like to say that I have not looked much in to this but I do know that there is some evidence of erosion between layers of rock viewable in the Grand Canyon
Related maybe indirectly to your argument:
"‘The presence of each unconformity is physical evidence that the Colorado Plateau (the area taking in the Grand Canyon) experienced consolidation of sediments, uplift, and possibly gentle tilting, weathering of the uplifted surface to form soil, and erosion by streams and wind before the sediments of the next formation (rock layer) were deposited. There must have been several of these episodes of consolidation, uplift, weathering, and erosion—a conclusion clearly at variance with the theory that the sediments were deposited during a year-long global flood." - Dr. Davis Young, Professor of Geology at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan, a Christian geologist.
I have not heard this sodium argument before so for now I will say nothing on it, I am looking forward to finding out what science has to say about it :-)
Now to your statement about Koalas. Here (and in your next paragraph) I think we have reached what I believe to be the major pitfall of religion in general. The question is not why shouldn't it be upside down. The question is why is it? Why would a creator do that? Not why shouldn't he, but why did he. There are plenty of examples of unintelligent design, which are illogical and perhaps unexplainable for a creator, but logical and perfectly explainable for evolution.
I guess you are right when you say I have never been outside of time, space and matter. But here is where the creationist rationale so interests and baffles me; "God is a Spirit. (No space, no matter) He has always existed. (No time) Just because nothing you have seen exists outside of time, space and matter doesn't mean there can't be something."
God is a Spirit - How can you know this? What is a spirit? Where is your evidence of this?
He has always existed - How can you know this? Where is your evidence?

person1: "I have a baseball."
person2: "Really? prove it!"
person1: "You can't prove I don't."
I realise that I will probably hear the word "strawman" out of this but I would still like to ask you shouldn't person1 prove that he has a baseball, instead of person2 proving he doesn't? Not meant to be derogatory or demeaning but I hope you can see the relevance.

Firstly everything I have read says that it is much much closer to 50% than 96%. This does not mean that humans are 50% banana or that bananas are 50% human. It is very important which parts are similar, and without knowing this, these statistics (and all like it) are useless. Of course we share some DNA code with everything, because there are genetic traits that are almost universally common. Such as respiration, transcription, translation, signaling cascades, transcriptional regulation, protein degradation. And might I add that this is consistent with evolution.
"A cloud is just about 100% water. A watermelon is just about 98% water. Does that mean they're related?" I'm sorry to say that I am at a complete loss as to what you mean by this. A cloud is not a living thing, it is not an organism. Also morphology, or physical appearance, does not correspond to genetic similarities. Why would anyone take water content to be an indication of relation?? Baffles me. Please consider how inheritance actually works. You are taking this way out of context (and you can not expect to understand evolution if you take facts out of context) unless I missed your point entirely.
The common ancestor between a human and a chimpanzee did not actually have* (stressing this word for later misquotes) to look like either. Just because something looks similar does not mean that it is- I repeat: morphology, or physical appearance, does not correspond to genetic similarities (ie we can be genetically more similar to things that we are physically more different from). If an almighty creator made everything than wouldn't we all be the same genetic distance from each other? This seems logical if we all came from the same creator, and that is how we are related.

So I guess what we are really arguing in that respect is whether or not the Bible is true. You believe it is true because you believe God wrote it? You believe in God because the Bible says he exists? Feel free to correct me there as that is clearly circular and can't really be true. Anyway I think we will have to leave that there at least for now because we clearly disagree and I don't think it will get any further.
"There is archeological evidence: the Dead Sea Scrolls, references to Jesus in secular writings..." Let's clear this up- I do believe that Jesus was a real person. I believe that he was probably a very nice man who did selfless acts and could be said to have morals (values, etc) before his time. I believe he is worthy of praise and I agree with a lot of the morals he pushed forth. I do not believe he was the son of God nor God himself nor a messenger of God (not sure what you believe so I tried to cover all bases).
As for the flood. I find this one of the more preposterous beliefs of creation theory. I didn't think anyone took the whole two-of-every-animal (Or was it five?

There are so many things wrong with a year long global flood (where did all this water come from/go?) from which all animals (geological locations weren't a problem?) escaped by somehow boarding a massive ark (450 odd feet? Longer than any wooden ship on modern seas, and that's with iron reinforcement and constant pumping of water) where all the animals managed to survive with each other and repopulate the world. (what about all the animals that died? Shouldn't we have overlaps in the fossil record? that specific time period a lot of animals should have died, so why are they so separated underground- in different types of rock, regardless of how old that rock really is, it means dinosaur fossils and mammal fossils should be at the same position. right?)

The Bible? Consistent?
One would expect the Bible to be consistent given that the four Gospels and Acts within were all supposedly the word of God. Unfortunately they are not consistent.
2 Samuel 8:4 states that King David captured 1700 horsemen, and 1 Chron. 18:4 claims he captured 7,000.

There was an earthquake, and an angel came down and rolled the stone away (Matt. 28:2) from the entrance of the tomb and sat on it, even though it had apparently already been rolled away when Mary Magdalene had got there (John 20:1, Mark 16:4, Luke 24:2). The reason for the visit was to anoint the body with spices (Mark 16:1, Luke 24:1) or just to look at the tomb (Matt. 28:1)" just an example of the 'Crucifixion and Resurrection Mess' if you would like to take a look at that and more inconsistencies here: http://www.bidstrup.com/bible2.htm

If you read further in to that quote though I think a logical deduction may be that there is no evidence, otherwise it wouldn't be called faith. Faith being the belief in something without evidence.

"There was undoubtedly massive seismic movement during the Flood". Undoubtedly? Then why doesn't this catastrophe (the flood itself or the seismic movement) show up in tree ring dating? (tree ring records go back over 10,000 years). How about ice cores from Greenland? They have been dated back more than 40,000 years by counting annual layers. "A worldwide flood would be expected to leave a layer of sediments, noticeable changes in salinity and oxygen isotope ratios, fractures from buoyancy and thermal stresses, a hiatus in trapped air bubbles, and probably other evidence. Why doesn't such evidence show up?"
As for your marine life:
"Shells on mountains are easily explained by uplift of the land. Although this process is slow, it is observed happening today, and it accounts not only for the seashells on mountains but also for the other geological and paleontological features of those mountains. The sea once did cover the areas where the fossils are found, but they were not mountains at the time; they were shallow seas.
A flood cannot explain the presence of marine shells on mountains for the following reasons:
Floods erode mountains and deposit their sediments in valleys.
In many cases, the fossils are in the same positions as they grow in life, not scattered as if they were redeposited by a flood. This was noted as early as the sixteenth century by Leonardo da Vinci (Gould 1998).
Other evidence, such as fossilized tracks and burrows of marine organisms, show that the region was once under the sea. Seashells are not found in sediments that were not formerly covered by sea"

1189,evolution,"Drop the specious misspelling of evolution. I present to you TalkOrigins:
Evolution merely describes part of nature. The fact that that part of nature is important to many people does not make evolution a religion. Consider some attributes of religion and how evolution compares:
1) Religions explain ultimate reality. Evolution stops with the development of life (it does not even include the origins of life).
2) Religions describe the place and role of humans within ultimate reality. Evolution describes only our biological background relative to present and recent human environments.
3) Religions almost always include reverence for and/or belief in a supernatural power or powers. Evolution does not.
4) Religions have a social structure built around their beliefs. Although science as a whole has a social structure, no such structure is particular to evolutionary biologists, and one does not have to participate in that structure to be a scientist.
5) Religions impose moral prescriptions on their members. Evolution does not. Evolution has been used (and misused) as a basis for morals and values by some people, such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and E. O. Wilson (Ruse 2000), but their view, although based on evolution, is not the science of evolution; it goes beyond that.
6) Religions include rituals and sacraments. With the possible exception of college graduation ceremonies, there is nothing comparable in evolutionary studies.
7) Religious ideas are highly static; they change primarily by splitting off new religions. Ideas in evolutionary biology change rapidly as new evidence is found.
Evolution may be considered a religion under the metaphorical definition of something pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion. This, however, could also apply to stamp collecting, watering plants, or practically any other activity. Calling evolution a religion makes religion effectively meaningless.
Evolution as religion has been rejected by the courts: B Assuming for the purposes of argument, however, that evolution is a religion or religious tenet, the remedy is to stop the teaching of evolution, not establish another religion in opposition to it. Yet it is clearly established in the case law, and perhaps also in common sense, that evolution is not a religion and that teaching evolution does not violate the Establishment Clause. /B

I can just as easily say that life on earth exists because a ghost on Neptune magically did it, and we would not be able to disprove this. And when logical people say, " no! a ghost on neptune did NOT create life on earth. You CAN'T prove that," neptune creationists would say "well you cannot prove that it DIDN'T create life on earth." YOU come up with a claim without logical reasoning, YOU provide the evidence.
And p.s- actually debate with me- don't give me books to read. This just suggests you don't have any knowledge of your own so you just defer me to other people's knowledge.",7,1,"It is not"
4454,evolution,"There are some flaws with this argument.
1. You are right, you don't need proof to assert that a house was built by SOMEONE, because humans build houses, humans have built houses, and will continue to do so. We have records and a ton of evidence that humans know how to and do build houses. Yes, that part is logic and common sense. However, that does not show WHO built it. Also, the universe and a house are completely different. We have a trail of evidence and reasoning that allows us to know that someone built the house. However, there is absolutely 0 evidence that allows us to think that someone built or created the universe. Just because the universe exists, that doesn't mean that someone created it. It is not logical to compare a house (which we have evidence and past records indicating a designer) to the universe (which we have no valid reason to think there is a designer)
2. The snowman one is the same as the house. We have records and knowledge that people can and do make them, so if you see a snowman, it is safe to not demand proof of a designer, because it is already understood. However, the universe does not have that understanding.
3. Yes, you do need evidence that the universe and planets were designed. No one in the world has yet to find any other than religious testimony, so it is safe to say that as of this point, there is no reason to believe in a designer.
4. "Intelligent design wins. Something more complex than a building or a snowman cannot naturally occur." This part of the argument makes the least sense. Volcanos, tornados, hurricanes, lightning, thunder, etc are more complex and they all occur naturally.",7,1,"It is not"
3616,evolution,"3. Therefore, there must be a Being whose existence is necessary
.. why? Why *must* it be a *Being*? Or can we call this a possible metaphor for something other than a Being? something perhaps that is not self-aware, does not have conscious thought. Could we still call this "Being" God?
And if it did not have to be a conscious Being, as is presumably at least implied, then could we still call it intelligent design when nothing in fact would have to be designed at all, much less intelligently?
In summary, why does it have to be a "Being"? The "unmoved mover" list above does not imply a being, until:
6. This is understood to be God.",7,1,"It is not"
3616,evolution,"" When we consider nature, wind moves things, planets rotate, etc. The
cause of this movement is unknown. Based on observation of the
world around us it is not unreasonable to conclude that some
conscious mind (being) is responsible for the motion of the
universe."
I'm sorry? the cause of this movement is unknown? Actually the cause of wind is very known, it is due to the heating of the atmosphere, hot air rises, cold air takes its place. Wind moves things because it has mass, and kinetic energy. It is not reasonable to conclude that a conscious being makes this movement. (Please note that at some point in the past it very well may have been reasonable to assume it was the Greek Gods known as the Anemoi, in fact it may have been unreasonable to conclude that is was simple science. As science took hold those Gods became irrelevant, useless, and most importantly needless - we no longer need those Gods to explain things)
"The only other option is that some unconscious thing is responsible for the motion of the universe. This, however, runs contrary to everything that we observe in the world around us."
What about atoms? We observe them moving spontaneously. Brownian Motion? Gravity?
Are you saying that everything in the world around us has a conscious thing responsible for its motion?
There are plenty of observations of the world around us that do not need a conscious mind.
"However, the Necessary Being must be conscious, because some of the beings that emanate from it are conscious. This is not unreasonable, we have never observed an unconscious being produce a conscious being."
Nor have we observed a conscious being create a universe, (or anything out of nothing) yet this is reasonable to conclude?
It seems more conceivable and reasonable to me that the universe itself is this Necessary (unconscious) Being.",7,1,"It is not"
