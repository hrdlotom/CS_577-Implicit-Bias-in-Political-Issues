613;evolution;"I see your points and they are valid. However, if you read up on your science you will realize that a large amount of science communities believe in a creationist of evolution. They look at the facts of order and possibilities as well. If you wanna call God a Sky Daddy, then I believe I can be just as skeptical about the universe and all of its order coming together from random parts of nothing. Its as if a BMW were formed from car parts just because you threw them together millions of years ago. Sorry folks but that is harder to believe for me than a someone or something orchestrating everything through order and detail.";7;1;3;Creation

1212;evolution;"Ah Creation vs Evolution. A debate that is essentially the debate since the release of "The Origin of Species" by Charles Darwin in 1859. Now let's look at each. In evolution, the general theory is that "populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection." Where as in Creation, the explanation is that someone/some being/some force created life as we know it. While evolutionary theory is a scientific theory (which is based on facts, creationism is more a belief or rather "faith based" as one puts it. At first appearances, it would seem that evolutionary theory has the upper hand since it "evolves" as discoveries are made. Whereas creationism fails because it's a set story and as inconsistencies are discovered, the belief becomes invalidated. But the idea that evolutionary theory "evolves" is essentially saying that the theory can "change" to fit the discoveries made. In essence, evolutionary theory is allowed to "change" its story provided that there is evidence to support a change. Creationism on the other hand, as a belief is based on faith not science. It's a belief that puts the responsibility of creating life into a "Creator" whether that creator is God, Shiva, the Force, or whatever is not the focal point. Oddly enough, Creationism seeks to explain the what I call the "moment" that started it all. Whereas evolutionary theory seeks to explain our past but not necessary the moment in which it all began. After all evolutionary theory states that all life stems from a common ancestor. But where did that common ancestor come from? In current evolutionary experiments, we can see microevolution and a limited degree of macroevolution. We can show how a primal soup of chemicals can form basic amino acids given certain conditions. We can show how single cell organisms can form into multi cell organisms. Yet to this day we can't show how basic amino acids can form a single cell organism. Science can discover and explain a lot of questions. Yet even now there are questions that science can't fully answer. Sure science can tell you that as a species your goal is to procreate and ensure the survival of your genes, but science can't tell you exactly what is your purpose in life.";7;1;3;Creation

1201;evolution;"The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.";7;1;3;Creation
1201;evolution;"God is abstract. He doesn't often show himself. In general, the idea of a god or gods is pretty hard to think about. Apes are concrete. You can see them. Generally, the whole ape concept is easy to get your hands around. It's funny that the supposedly unsophisticated ancients would all choose to believe in an abstract concept rather than a concrete one. If you asked Adam where he came from, why would he say "God must have created me, I've seen Him around the garden" instead of "I was magically transformed from one of those apes over there"?";7;1;3;Creation
1201;evolution;"One of evolution's major problems is a moral one. Evolution states that creatures change over time. When a creature is more fit than those around it, it takes over. As a result, the best creature rises to the top. It is claimed that all this is in the best interest of the species. If that were true, it would justify a whole bunch of things that most people disagree with. White men kept slaves in the South, and slavery stuck around for some time. And when the slaves were freed, they didn't free themselves - white men from the North did most of the work. Does this mean that white men were more fit than the slaves and that the plantation owners were justified in keeping slaves? There are plenty of other examples. Terrorists (and their American counterparts), the Darfur conflict, feudalism... Evolution implies that the side with the upper hand deserves to win. This post isn't a very scientific argument, I know, but I don't think I could ever accept the "might makes right" mindset.";7;1;3;Creation
1201;evolution;"I stand corrected - there is rigor in evolutionary research. However, not all of it is scientific, and a lot of it is based on exaggerated facts, half-truths, and assumptions. I mentioned the dates in rock strata for two reasons. First of all, my post was a reply to burnman, who claimed the Earth was older than 10,000 years. Second, geology, which I concede isn't the exact same thing as evolutionary theory, is still very important. Evolution requires incredible amounts of time - if the proposed periods of time don't line up with the strata or the fossil records the strata contain, that's a pretty big problem with evolution. I found The Origin of Species on Wikisource and am reading through it. Any interesting passages?";7;1;3;Creation
975;evolution;"Unfortunately, the title of this discussion is wrong. Instead of being Evolution vs. Creationism, it should be: Does God exist? Creationism and evolution are not exclusionary. Creationism implies that a Higher Power, a God, orchestrated the creation of this planet and its inhabitants. Evolution may very well have been one of the tools used to accomplish this. As to whether God exists (however you choose to define God), each person has to decide for themselves. I look at the world around me, the thousands of beautiful plants, animals, etc, and think that their must be a Higher Power behind it all. Mathematically, it seems like it would take much more than a few billion years for a world to evolve by chance to what we experience today. It could take a few billion iterations just for someone to guess my password. It doesn't make sense to me that the earth could evolve to what it has become in its short (few billion years?) history by chance. More than that, my soul tells me there is a God.";7;1;3;Creation
1201;evolution;"The different parts of the embryo don't grow at the same rate. What looks like a tail is really the spine, which develops earlier and starts off longer than the rest of the embryo. The body then "fills it out," so to speak. There are several other features that are often cited as evidence of evolution, such as "gill slits," "yolk sacs," and other bits and pieces that were supposedly left over from evolutionary ancestors. However, many of these comparisons are based on appearance, not function. Just because something looks like a _____ doesn't prove that it used to be a _____. Many frequently cited claims of evolutionary leftovers in the embryo are part of the theory of recapitulation. This theory was widely published in old textbooks and so remains a common misconception, but nowadays even mainstream scientists reject at least most of it, as it was based mostly on guesswork and exaggerated illustrations.";7;1;3;Creation

975;evolution;"jwdunn, first of all, I appreciate the tone of your post, so I chose to reply to you even though you weren't the only one to make some of your points. Two points: 1. RE: this couldn't happen by chance. First of all, my understanding of the universe is too limited to know if 13.7 billion years x 150 billion galaxies x 1 trillion stars x 5 planets per star makes for good odds or bad odds for a planet to exist by chance that has the right orbit, spin, tilt, elements, etc to support life. However, for life to evolve like it has from essentially nothing on such a planet in just a few billion years by chance seems pretty far-fetched to me. Even still, suppose mathematically it isn't so far-fetched. It still doesn't invalidate creationism. If evolution was a tool used by God to populate the earth, He might have "only" set the Universe in motion to accomplish this, or, in my opinion at the moment given my limited understanding, He might have used "accelerators" to speed up the evolutionary process so that we could reach this point in "just" a few billion years. 2. RE: Creationism is an argument that came from a time when humans believed the earth was the center of the universe. Creationism came from, and still comes from, people who devote significant effort to trying to commune with God--whoever God is. Millions, or billions, of people claim that they are able to pray to God and feel his influence in their lives. That has been true for thousands of years, and continues to be true today. Just as I have no way of convincing someone who refuses to honestly devote effort to communicating with God that he does exist, there is no way for me to be convinced that he doesn't exist. Finally, if God is all knowing and all powerful, the implication is that God knows science perfectly. As a result, it makes perfect sense to me that he would understand and use tools like evolution (that we only partially understand) to accomplish his designs.";7;1;3;Creation

Why hasn't there been a mass monkey revolution a la "Planet of the Apes" ? With the threat of global warming looming, why do we still get skin cancer? Shouldn't we be developing some sort of "adaptable trait" which allows us not be harmed by the sun's rays? And why has pollution made our lungs worse and not better?

1212;evolution;"However, the fact remains that creationism is not inserted into Evolutionary theory on the basis that there are no "scientifically reproducible" evidence that gives credit to creationism. That's why there's a difference and that's why we're having this debate. Now looking back at my original post, the definition I set forth for Evolutionary Theory is the one that is commonly accepted from the works of Charles Darwin in the Species of Origins which was (as aforementioned) in 1859. Using that basis for evolution theory was my starting point. Naturally if you wanted to use a different definition for your starting point then yes I might be incorrect. But I digress, let us examine your defining point then. Evolutionary theory, according to you, is the general theory about how life came about. Based on natural selection and the predominance of certain genes being passed down from generation to generation (which also meant that some genes were not passed down). And while there is significant evidence to support this theory, there is little evidence of how it started. How did a lifeless planet "form" life? What was the first starting point? The first formation of an organism from various building blocks? The first generation to "pass its genes" to the next? For these questions, Evolutionary theory has no answer. Creationism does however have "general" answers. Now I realize that some may point to the fact that these "answers" are typically very vague (i.e. how does a rib from a man be formed into a woman?), but consider the author and audience at the time. Examine how you would go about explaining electricity to someone from the 8th Century A.D. Now going back to my original point I do concede that I digressed in the last paragraph, but let me instead end with examining logicchop's analogy of evolution theory is similar to the scientific view that matter is made up of smaller things. Odd that one would choose that particular example as our knowledge of that field has come to some serious dead ends. Now I'm no physicist, but I did take a few classes back in college. Sure matter is made from smaller things (i.e. atoms) and those atoms are made up of even smaller things (i.e. electrons, protons, and neutrons) and those things are even made up of smaller things (i.e. leptons, quarks, etc.). Yet despite the various theories (both true and false) we have yet figured out how these atoms came to be. Did something create these leptons and quarks? Where they pre-existing? Did the transfer of energy create these leptons and quarks? If so who created the energy? The problem now becomes a hundredfold more complicated as various scientific theorems, laws, and principles invalidates possible explanations to this unique phenomenon. The explanation is considered the Unified Field Theory, a holy grail of sorts for the scientific (particularly the physics side) community. So there you have it. Perhaps the question for debate should have included a framework in which both sides can accurately engage in a "civil" debate rather than take assumptions that may (or may not) be true.";7;1;3;Creation
76;evolution;"Ah yes, the classic peppered moth argument I'm very familiar with it I'm not sure how that proves the evolutionary process Both moth colors have always been there Its just a matter of which is it easier for their prey to see. That's not evolution- That's a diet plan";7;1;3;Creation

975;evolution;"---------------- However, I don't think standard "polite" argument is going to convince any creationists that evolution is true. Creationists have been brainwashed by forces in their childhood. From birth, they have been indoctrinated with false truths. To reverse this, they need to be shocked out of their stupour. Of course, what they really need are sessions with a psychiatrist, perhaps with shock treatment. ---------------- That's a little silly in my opinion. Everyone comes with their own biases. To paraphrase a Christian saying, you might want to consider removing the beam in your own eye before trying to help Creationists remove the mote in their eyes. ---------------- I think we might need to redefine Creationism for the purposes of this debate. Shouldn't it be limited to the appearance of humans in the historical record? Evolutionists: "Humans evolved over millions of years from earlier forms of life." Creationists: "Man was created by God in the Garden of Eden and Woman was created from one of Man's ribs." Or have creationists accepted all of the scientific evidence of evolution? ---------------- I disagree. Creationists believe that some Higher Power, a God, is responsible for creating the universe--including this planet and also man. Evolutionists (as pitted against Creationists) believe that there is no God behind all that we know to exist. There may be some Creationists who believe that God literally created Adam in the Garden of Eden, but there are others who don't even believe in the Christian God--let alone Adam and Eve. I am a Christian and believe in the divinity of Jesus, but that doesn't mean I have to believe that the Bible is entirely correct or that it is literal. I embrace learning through the scientific method and have had no problems whatsoever accepting both my Christian beliefs and scientific learning at the same time. So far, I have seen no conflicts between the two. The conflicts come when people want to extrapolate from what we have actually learned through science and create "theories" for which we have no real proof. The science of evolution is interesting and educational. The theory that God doesn't exist because of what we learn from scientific observations is just that--a theory--no more provable than the idea that God does in fact exist. Unfortunately for evolution, the scientific principles and learnings are unnecessarily grouped so tightly with the theory that God doesn't exist that the two are effectively merged into one for most people. That is obvious in the classroom, in this thread, and anywhere the topic of "evolution" is brought up. I embrace the scientific principles and observations of evolution. I reject the theory that God doesn't exist, and have yet to see anyone offer a good argument in favor of that theory.";7;1;3;Creation

975;evolution;"Your bias is not towards science. Your bias goes far beyond that and is a bias against God. Science cannot prove or disprove God. Science can't say a thing about how the universe came to be, whether or not there is more to our existence than just this life, whether or not we have an obligation to do "good" (whatever that is) during our lives, etc. Religion is effectively a collection of beliefs that typically include some answers about what right and wrong are, why we exist in this universe, and so on. You may not call your set of beliefs a religion since the word "religion" is typically tied to belief in a God. However, they are your own substitute for organized religion. I believe in science just as much as you do. The difference is that I don't then put my faith in theories that go FAR beyond the science while condemning others for not accepting my beliefs. To sum it up, I can't prove God exists, and you can't prove he doesn't. I can't prove how the universe got to this point, and neither can you.

828;evolution;"This is an interesting debate in that there is so much confusion regarding what it actually means that it turns into more of a religious fight than anything else. For instance you first have to determine whether the argument is the origin of the universe was natural or by intelligent design (ID). Second you have to determine do you think the earth is billions of years old or only 10 thousand or so. I love the fact that many on the evolutionary side have clarified that evolution only explains the history of the world around us, not it's origins. Also, intelligent design does require faith that there is a supreme power out there whatever name you want to apply to it. For me, I personally go for the Christian God created the universe around 10,000 years ago. I know many in the scientific community will argue it, but I am a Christian and believe that the Bible is the inerrant Word of God. I have also read many articles that state many scientific facts that help to support this idea (see www.icr.org). Finally, with all the articles I have read on evolution as well, it appears that you definitely have to have some faith for some of the claims some of the scientists are making and if I have to choose where I rest my faith it will be on the Bible.";7;1;3;Creation

987;evolution;"Not exactly..........You have to agree there is some evidence. What would you say is the very best evidence for creationism? Does good evidence exist for creationism? Can that evidence for creationism be classified as very good evidence? If so, what is the very best evidence for creationism? Creation is one of two possible origin explanations. Both life and everything we see was either created or it evolved by a random process. Consequently, any evidence against evolution is very good evidence for creationism. Alternatively, evidence for creationism can be direct evidence rather than evidence against evolution. To identify the very best evidence for creationism, we need to look at both the best indirect evidence (against evolution) and the best direct evidence for creation. Evidence against evolution: There is much evidence against biological macroevolution. Some of Darwin’s evidence used to support evolution is now refuted because of more modern scientific evidence. One fact is that body parts or entities could not have evolved gradually. Michael Behe discovered that cells were irreducibly complex. They needed every single chemical and part to function. Consequently, they could not have gradually evolved. Another evidence was the complete lack of transitional forms in the fossil record. We have not been able to create life from non-life regardless of how hard we have tried. We have not been able to create one species from another even with human intervention. The things that have been used as examples of evolution either have supported microevolution or have been hoaxes, frauds, or have used artistic license to extrapolate conclusions without justification. However, the best evidences against macroevolution and hence the very best evidence for creationism, is the unimaginable complexity and machine-like workings of a single cell including DNA, RNA, and the manufacture of proteins, etc. None of this was known during Darwin’s time. They thought the cell was a simple blob of protoplasm. The human genome contains so much information it would fill libraries if contained in books. The machine-like workings of a cell have been related to our most sophisticated factories. Nobody would ever suggest that random processes could generate libraries of information or make a manufacturing plant. This favors creationism. Direct evidence for Creation: The Big Bang theory is the current scientific explanation of our origin. It places the origin of our universe at a specific time in the past. So whether we believe in science or believe in creation or both, we believe we came from nothing at a specific time in the past. The difference is that the Big Bang states that everything was created from nothing without a cause or a purpose. Alternatively, if we believe in creation, we believe that everything came from nothing by the will of an omnipotent, transcendent Creator that is not limited to time and space and we were created for a purpose. This completely explains how apparent design and complexity could have come into existence. However, the very best evidence for creationism is the claim by God Himself that He created light, the universe, the Earth and all life. You might question whether that argument holds up under scientific scrutiny? We all know the creation story in Genesis, but how can we know directly through scientific rationale that it is true. We can show that it was written in the Old Testament, but how can we show direct evidence that it is true? We only need to accept the most thoroughly documented history in existence and examine the evidence for who Jesus was. Our calendar is based upon the birth of Jesus. How historical is that? In Mark 13:19 (NKJV) Jesus stated, “For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of creation which God created until this time, nor ever shall be.” Could Jesus have been anything other than what He claimed to be, the God of creation? C.S. Lewis in “Mere Christianity” addresses the possibilities of who Jesus could have been. He concludes that He couldn’t have just been a great moral teacher. He had to be the Son of God, a lunatic or the Devil. He certainly wasn’t a lunatic or the Devil so He had to be the Son of God. If He is the Son of God and He said God created everything, then this is the very best direct evidence for creationism. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼";7;1;3;Creation

THE FALLACIES OF EVOLUTION "It is inherent in any definition of science that statements that cannot be checked by observation, are not really saying anything—or at least they are not science." —*George G. Simpson, " The Nonprevalence of Humanoids, " in Science 143 (1964) p. 770. "In accepting evolution as fact, how many biologists pause to reflect that science is built upon theories that have been proved by experiment to be correct, or remember that the theory of animal evolution has never been thus approved." —*L. H. Matthews, "Introduction," Origin of Species, Charles Darwin (1971 edition). "Evolution is baseless and quite incredible."—*Ambrose Flemming, President British Association for Advancement of Science, in The Unleashing of Evolutionary Thought. "Present-day ultra-Darwinism, which is so sure of itself, impresses incompletely informed biologists, misleads them, and inspires fallacious interpretations . . "Through use and abuse of hidden postulates, of bold, often ill-founded extrapolations, a pseudoscience has been created. It is taking root in the very heart of biology and is leading astray many biochemists and biologists, who sincerely believe that the accuracy of fundamental concepts has been demonstrated, which is not the case." —*Pierre P. Grasse, The Evolution of Living Organisms (1977), p. 202. Evolutionists tend to ignore both deductive factors (principles, natural laws), and inductive discoveries (scientific facts). "Charles Darwin claimed to have created his theory of evolution by means of natural selection 'according to the true Baconian principles of induction.' In fact, he did no such thing, but it was customary in his day that a true scientists worked by finding patterns or laws by gathering great quantities of 'facts.' " —*R. Milner, Encyclopedia of Evolution (1990), p. 236. The inductive method gathers the facts and then decides on patterns they form, and laws to be formulated from them. But *Darwin devised theories, irregardless of the facts. Sedgwick, the well-known geologist who was first to teach *Darwin something about the subject, wrote this to the author of Origin of the Species, just after it was published: "You have deserted the true method of induction and started off in machinery as wild as Bishop Wilkin's locomotive that was to sail with us to the Moon." —Adam Sedgwick, Letter dated January 1860, to Charles Darwin. ARRIVING AT TRUTH BY LARGER ANALYSIS—A major flaw of the so-called "scientific method" is its insistence that it can include in its field of studies only that which can be submitted to a rather quick little experiment. How much electrical voltage is needed to make a frog's leg move? The scientists can figure out that one. Which helps people more: Christianity or atheism? Scientists have no way to analyze that in a laboratory, so they throw up their hands in blank ignorance and declare it to be an unanswerable question, there is no way of telling. But, using a broader base of experimental analysts, it is not at all difficult to ascertain such conclusions. Scientists will tell us there is no way to test such a matter the first time, and no way to repeat the experiment a second time in order to verify it. —But the experiment is being worked out continually all about us on both large and small scale, and it is being repeated constantly. The method of testing is by observation of the great law of causal relation over a period of time. This is also called cause-and-effect. Another way of expressing it is, "By their fruits ye shall know them." That is an excellent means of scientific analysis. Who establishes orphanages to help small children who have lost their parents? Christians or atheists? Who goes into the slums to help people? How many atheist societies have sent missionaries to desolate places to help people learn a better way of life? How many atheist societies have founded universities for the benefit of mankind? Which side leads out in efforts to continue the killing of innocent unborn children? Christians or atheists? Which group produces the alcoholics, dictators, and suicides more frequently? The creation-evolution debate has waged for over a century and leaders have arisen on both sides of the conflict. Which side has resorted to hoaxes, fakes, false claims, threats and coercion to achieve its victories? Which side patiently asks that scientific facts be considered? Thus we find, evidence that points not only to the relative truth of the claims of each side and to the ultimate truth as to which is correct, but we also learn the effect of each set of beliefs on the minds of those adhering to them. Enough time has elapsed in the controversy that we can clearly see that one theory insidiously destroys human morality and men's perception of truth, while the other rests its case on scientific facts. Yes, there are ways of knowing truth that the "scientific method" refuses to consider. Charles Darwin was one of his geological students and the two kept up a correspondence while Darwin was aboard the HMS Beagle. However, Sedgwick never accepted the case for evolution made in the Origin of Species any more than he did in the Vestiges. In response to receiving and reading Darwin's book, he wrote to Darwin saying: "If I did not think you a good tempered and truth-loving man I should not tell you that ... I have read your book with more pain than pleasure. Parts of it I admired greatly, parts I laughed at till my sides were almost sore, other parts I read with absolute sorrow, because I think them utterly false and grievously mischievous. You have deserted - after a start in that tram-road of all solid physical truth - the true method of induction ..."[3] 1 - Fallacy of Relevance. The argument from irrelevance occurs when the conclusion depends on evidence that does not apply to the same point. The next paragraph would be a true statement: "Scientists do not yet understand the function of certain body organs. In the past, there were large numbers of organs whose purpose was not known, today there are but few. Each decade more and more information has been obtained about various body organs. The obvious conclusion from those facts is that if organic functions are not known, it will only be a matter of time before further research discloses those functions." In contrast, evolutionists irrelevantly contend that all such organs lack functions entirely! They declare that such organs have not had any functions for thousands of years, and are leftovers from our animal ancestors! That conclusion bears no relation to the facts. A hundred years ago the functions of dozens of organs were unknown. Gradually functions were found, today nearly all human organs have known functions. Yet certain evolutionists continue to declare that those organs are inherently functionless. 2 - Begging the Question. This fallacy occurs when a person presents his own assurance that he is telling the truth as the reason why his statement is true. (1) "I have been a scientist all my life, and I can tell you that evolution is true." (2) "Evolution has been fully vindicated and proven by science, I have witnessed this over and over again all my life." (3) "You can take my word for it, evolution is true." Repeatedly, in this set of books, we have observed instances of this blockade to careful thinking. Over and over again, evolutionists have maintained in articles and speeches that evolution has been fully proven, and is accepted universally by all reputable scientists. We are to believe these statements because the one telling us is supposed to be a renowned scientist. No other evidence is given, for, indeed, no other evidence for such statements dare be given. (See chapter 31 and 37.) 3 - Misuse of Authority. This error is similar to the one just mentioned. "Because we are the authorities on the matter, therefore what we say is correct. " The public is asked to ‘just let the scientists decide for you" as to the truth about evolution. But what is needed is evidence, not statements of assurance by scientists. After 150 years of searching for evidence in support of evolution, we need assurance from facts, not assurance from the men searching for the facts. (See chapter 31.) Evolutionists tell us that "mutations are the cause of beneficial changes in species, and, ultimately, changes across species. This is so, "we are told, "because scientists are sure it is so. " But the evidence does not support the claim. Not one mutation in a million is beneficial, so how could mutations produce useful change—since literally billions of beneficial—and closely inter-related mutations would be needed in order to produce a new species. (See chapter 14.) 4 - False Comparisons. When two items are wrongly compared in an argument, this fallacy occurs. The peppered moth argument is an example of this. The one species of moth comes in two different colors. "Because birds ate the dark ones on light-bark trees before the 1850s, and have tended to eat the light ones on dark-bark trees since then, therefore this is a powerful evidence that one type of creature evolves into a different type." But in the case of the moths, they are both sub-species of the same peppered moth, and both sub-species existed before 1800, and today both sub-species still exist. Changes within species does not constitute evolution, and in regard to peppered moths, no change within species has occurred, much less across species. (See chapter 13.) 5 - Argumentum ad Populum. This is an argument addressed "to the people." This occurs when popular feelings are pandered to, when people are told what they want to hear—and what they are told is declared to be a "scientific fact." (1) "Science is progressive and is itself evolutionary" (2) "Evolution is the belief of moderns. " (3) "Everyone that is educated believes this theory." An implication of much of the evolutionary teaching is that our race has raised itself by its own bootstraps and we will eventually be gods, knowing and doing every possible thing, including inter-galactic space travel. All this appeals to the public, and they are assured that evolution must be true. At least, they surely hope so.";7;1;3;Creation
987;evolution;"Really.........so how did a bird evolve under the rule of natural selection? First it began growing nubs on each side. How does that make it more superior or stronger? The nubs become half a wing? Now the creature cannot fly but is wabbleling around falling over,crashing through the brush and noext it's bones start becoming hollow and brittle. It would actually become the weakest and easiest to catch and eat. The bird through Darwin's process would never have been. That's why he is called a nut by his own professor at Cambridge.

1002;evolution;"I agree with the idea that there is a lot more evidence pointing towards evolution, however I would like to question the nature of this evidence. The fact of the matter is the evidence is worldly and scientific. As humans, we tend to find reason for things. Using science to prove a scientific theory is like saying "cheese is cheese". You're using what you have learned and can never know is really true to prove it is true. The small amount of evidence pointing towards creationism is arguably more philosophical and sometimes scientific, however often times it is regaurded as something beyond our understanding. Our human minds aren't able to fully grasp the nature of creationism, and that is why it is not fully accepted. As far as creationism being something ancient people have used to explain our natural world, I like to think of it differently. Ancient people had established that the world was created, not just there. Rather than them using it as reason for explaining the world, the architect used the world to explain things to them. Their existence, nature, etc. Plus, the concept of creationism being a longer lasting idea and belief than science calls into question why. And why is it still around? If it is so unreasonable, and science so convincing, why has it not died out? The reason why was touched upon in your last paragraph. Creationism is something concrete and established. It usually doesn't evolve or change. This solid idea does not expierence huge or incremental advances, but gives reason and explanation and hope and faith, something evolution and science cannot provide. Also, consider why science can often be incorporated into creationism, but usually creationism cannot be incorporated into science.";7;1;3;Creation

1210;evolution;"Ten Reasons Creation Is A Better Explanation Than Evolution 1) The Universe...How did it originate? The First and Second Law of Thermodynamics are great evidence for a supernatural entity. The Universe is composed of matter and energy. Is the Universe eternal? No. The Second Law of Thermodynamics teaches that matter and energy are functions of time and that over time they decay. Since matter and energy are functions of time, they can not be independent of time (eternal). The overwhelming majority of scientists believe the Universe is not eternal. If it is not eternal, it had a beginning. Was this beginning natural? the First Law of Thermodynamics says it was not. Matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed according to the First law of Thermodynamics. Thus, an atheistic belief that the Universe "poofed" from nothing by natural means is anti-science. It is blind faith. Laws of Science show that belief in a supernatural entity is the best explanation of how the universe began, since these Laws of Thermodynamics falsify atheistic belief. 2) Life...How Did It Originate? Atheists think life originated by a natural process of chemicals mixing with energy. They can believe this, but it is anti-science and a blind faith belief. The Law of Biogenesis states life only comes from life. This law is the foundation of Biology. Since life did not originate from non-life by natural means, the best explanation is that it had a supernatural origin. 3) Design. A simple definition of design is something that was planned for. The human body has 60,000 miles of blood vessels in it. The smallest blood vessels are so small, that only one red blood cell at a time can pass through it - after its nucleus has fallen off! Red blood cells lose their nuclei so that they can be small enough to pass through your tiniest capillaries. Piping systems do not happen by chance. Especially ones that are this complex. 4) Information. You started out as one tiny fertilized egg. Just one cell. Today you are 75 trillion cells. But you are not the same cell over and over and over again. You started as one cell, but now you have skin cells, hair cells, muscle cells, bone cells, nerve cells, blood cells etc! You have over 200 different cells in your body! One cell in your body is in your digestive tract and all it appears to do is to make mucus! Isn't that cool? And not only do you have all of these cells.....they are in the right place. You don't have bones cells on your eye ball, you don't hair cells in your spine. You are a 75 trillion piece jig saw puzzle with all the pieces in the right place. Jig saw puzzles don't get put together by chance. Do you think you did? Think. You started out as one cell, but in that cell you contained all the information required to make more cells and produce a living organism with 75 trillion cells, over 200 different types of cells and 60,000 miles of blood vessels. Information comes from an information giver. Not from nothing, nor by chance. 5) Systems. Suppose you evolved 60,000 miles of blood vessels by chance. Will it do you any good? No. You need blood, and a heart. Suppose you evolved blood and a heart and 60,000 miles of blood vessels by chance. Will it do you any good? No. You need a nervous system, a skeletal system, a digestive system, a respiratory system etc. But all of those systems are useless without the circulatory system! Creation believes in instant people. You can't wait around for a liver to evolve. Creation believes a supernatural entity instantly made humans with functioning hearts, livers, lungs, brains, kidneys, spleens, intestines etc. This makes sense because they all need each other to function and to keep the organism alive. 6) Sex. Which came first the chicken or the egg? Two chickens, a functional male and functional female (please see chicken and egg article on this web site). For the many animals that reproduce by sexual reproduction, they need male equipment in part of the population and female equipment in the other part of the population. Both systems are very complex and very unique. Once again, creationists believe in "instant people." And that includes instant males and instant females. My dad is my favorite philosopher. He once said, "You know why Adam and Eve had to be adults? Because human babies are so helpless!" great point dad! 7) Living Evidence. If the theory of evolution occurred, there had to be transitional forms. These transitional forms were the animals that were the "links" between reptiles and birds, ape-men and humans etc. There would have had to be millions of these transitional forms! But not one is alive today. Why not? Either they never existed or they did exist and all vanished. If they do exist today where are they? If they don't exist today, that is powerful evidence for Creation. If the theory of evolution is true, this should be true. You have an ape in a cage at a zoo. You pay 50 bucks to look at the ape. If the theory of evolution is true, there should be living organisms that get a 25 dollar discount because the ape in the cage is a close relative. 8) Fossil Evidence. There are trillions of fossils. yet, in my opinion (trying to be fair here) no transitional forms. evolutionists will claim there are many, but upon close scrutiny, each one can easily be classified as belonging to animals alive today, or an organism that is not transitional, but simply extinct (i.e. trilobites or dinosaurs). If the theory of evolution is true, there should be millions of transitional forms. Lets suppose the theory of evolution is true. Evolutionists believe reptiles are ancestral to birds. The fossil record should have thousands of fossils of half legs/half wings, half scales half feathers, half reptile feet/half bird feet etc. Yet none of these clear transitional fossils exist. many quotes by Evolutionists support this claim. 9) Genetics and Biochemistry. To quote my daughter when she was three and talking to a high school girl: "Don't forget, crows make crows." She is right, and genetics supports her contention. Crow DNA can only make a crow. If you mutate it, you might get a goofy crow, or a dead crow, or an unchanged crow, but you won't get a different animal. Mutations make lung cancer, they don't make lungs. 10) The Anthropic Principle. The earth has the proper temperature, the proper gravity, the proper amount of oxygen, the proper mass ratio of the electron and proton, the proper charge between electrons and protons etc. etc. etc. The odds of an average protein getting the proper sequence by chance is enormous. Let's look at the odds. Imagine an alphabet with 20 letters. Suppose I made a word from this alphabet that was 400 letters long, and asked you to guess the sequence of letters that make up the word. What would be the odds that you would guess it by chance? The odds would be one to 20 times 20 times 20 times 20......400 times! It would be 1 to 20 to the 400th power. This is the same as one to ten to the 520th power. That is a 1 followed by 520 zeros. The odds are greater that you would win California super lotto 500 times in a row than one protein sequence occurring by chance. We are not even talking about a cell, much less an organ, much less a human body. In statistics, something that is 10 to the 50th is considered impossible. Thus one protein by chance is highly impossible. Think of this for a second. If the odds against a protein sequence happening by chance is 10 to the 520th power, the odds that it happened by design is the inverse, 10 to the 520th power in favor of it. Those odds make design infinitely more logical statistically than chance.";7;1;3;Creation
1190;evolution;"1) God created the universe - that means He also created time. Doesn't it make sense then that He is outside time? I know it's a little mind-boggling - our finite minds will never comprehend everything that the Bible teaches. But there is something called faith. 2) God CREATED Adam and Eve. Does that mean they need parents? Generally something that is created does need something before it (other than the creator) to give it life. 3)The Bible does say something about how having sex with your sibling is wrong. But guess what - it was after Adam and Eve. When Adam and Eve were created, they were genetically perfect - without any mutations or diseases which have arisen because of sin. That means that there was no danger in marrying your sibling - they were genetically diverse. Keep in mind too, that Adam and Eve had a LOT of children - Adam lived for 900+ years (due to the perfection of his created body), having children for a good part of it. You can hardly expect the relationship between the children to be the same brother-sister relationship it is now. God made the law against incest after the genetics began to deteriorate, and also as family ties grew closer. (I'm arguing this not because Adam and Eve were brother and sister - they were created as husband and wife! - but because their children would have married each other, as there were no other humans around).";7;1;3;Creation
1238;evolution;"It's probably nothing particularly insightful but it appears to me that evolutionist are in a bind. To be a scientist today you need to agree with the scope of science -- which is to study observable (direct or indirec) phenomenon in the universe, notice patterns, create hypothesis, conjectures, and theories to account for those observable phenomena. Perhaps somewhat hidden in being a modern day scientist is the assumption -- unstated and unexamined because it can't be examined by science -- that all observable phenomena have a cause which exists within the universe. To posit a cause outside the physical universe for the existence of something within the universe is, by general unspoken agreement, not science. Thus, if the unspoken premise of science -- that all phenomena within the universe have causes accountable from within that universe -- if that is true then either there exists process in the universe by which life evolved, or there is a process completely unknown to science by which we "sprang" into existence in a short, or perhaps relatively short time. The observations, hypothesis, conjectures, etc. of most scientists assume the former since there are, as far as I know, no processes suggested by which what is observed could have happened withing a closed universe -- closed meaning nothing (except perhaps the big bang) can have occured within the universe except by the laws of the universe. Therefore, the unaddressed debate is not: evolution vs creation, but "open or closed." If science cannot allow for postulating a cause for things in the universe that is outside that universe, then they are practicing a restricted science. This is not to say the evidence they have is not sufficient, good, or even conclusive. It is saying that their own assumption makes it impossible for them to realistically postulate a creationist point of view as scientists. One wonders if they did, and they put as much research into a counter theory as they have in evolutionary theory, if the creationist postulate wouldn't be more respected.";7;1;3;Creation

Then, MaGiCalLy(ooooooohhhh) this turned into a single cell, and the MAGICALLY by sheer coincidence that bacteria turned into a single cell. Ooohhh this is my favoritepart. After that somehow all of the more cell came together (COINCIDENTALY) and LOOK we have an eye...now how in the world did that happen? O YA! thats right SHEER COINCIDENCE. Now, thay eye need oxygen because goodness knows all tissues need oxygen, so COINCIDENTALY MORE cells came together and LOOK there was a lung. Now of course we need more organs supporting each other to make and organism, so BANG now there are a bunch or organ made out of tissue made out of cells that just coincidentaly fit together.

1211;evolution;"Not all debates are based on evidence, some are based on persuasion, which is the act of convincing by reaching out to one's emotions, feelings, and sensitivity rather than sensibleness alone. I therefore believe that there is no harm nor shame in considering creationism to be the right doctrine to adopt. I'm Muslim, I believe in Allah, our creator and only God, I also believe that Adam and Eve were the first human beings (Not brother and sister as someone suggested, since they were created by God), furthermore, I believe that God created everything that exists, which includes stuff we're not really aware of, and things that we haven't necessarily seen. All these convictions and beliefs are of course direct consequences of faith since, in your own words, we don't have any tangible and concrete evidence of it. But I completely disagree, everything that surrounds you is as much an evidence that there is a creator as you yourself are, some may argue that nature's extremely fascinating ability to adapt and 'evolve' is capable of producing a miracle such as life and intellect, but the fact of the matter is, no one can explain using "evidence" how nature itself came to exist in the first place. As someone previously said, Evolution is unable to determine the 'origin' of life and that of the known universe and instead dwells on explaining how it has continuously evolved. To conclude, I would say that however good nature might be at evolving, in no way would that ability to adjust have been capable of achieving such an incredible balance, precision and sense of purpose. I believe, in God.";7;1;3;Creation
1211;evolution;"I think what's happened here is you haven't quite understood what the notions we're debating about actually mean. Creationism is the current that stresses the existence of a creator rather than believes that everything that we're witnessing is merely a result of some evolutionary chain reactions, what I mean is, it's not "a belief that explains how everything started" And that's it! Which is how you made it sound, it's a belief that tells us that everything, originally, was created and then nature took its course! Now, to your "who am I and who are you" reasoning, I'd rather debate in an argumentative manner, rather than point out that neither of us, in fact that most of the people on the website aren't exactly "qualified" to debate of anything properly... Knowing that, here are some people who know what they're talking about : The pioneers of the experimentalist doctrine often say that any scientific assumption is only as reliable and as trust-worthy as its ability to withstand constant testing and experimenting allows it to be, this idea began with the early works of Sir Isaac Newton but also with Galileo's, Pierre Thuilier also added that these experiments will never provide us with scientific certainty, but only give us indirect convincive elements. On the other hand, the adepts of the more abstract and radical rational doctrine, such as Einstein or Duhem, state that the only way to measure a scientific assumption's correctness is by gauging the homogeneity of its mathematic principles. Karl Popper's criteria for scientific cerainty however is the hypothesis's falsifiability. Now, I haven't just brought all of these ideas up for nothing. As you can see, the only reason why science cannot explain where everything originated from is because, in either of its major doctrines would a hypothesis stand to reason. And I'm sorry, but that's not good enough for me. We may be living the pinnacle, and the apotheosis of human evolution science-wise, but I strongly believe that man should NOT abandon the spiritual aspects of his life, they are what separates us from animals, to be brutally honest. Hence, believing in a creator adds a sense of purpose to life, thus allowing us to grow hope, be more positive about our existence and therefore be more productive in every field that we dare explore.";7;1;3;Creation

1245;evolution;"The problem here is that both creationists and evolutionists are looking for evidence where there is none. By way of analogy, think of acceleration. Acceleration is a change in velocity/speed over time. Compare two vehicles. One accelerates from a stop at a rate of 9.8fps/ps. It takes almost 1100 feet for it to reach a speed of 100 mph. The other vehicle has instant acceleration. Within no time or distance, it accelerates from a full stop to 100 mph. The result of both accelerations is the same. The vehicles are traveling at 100 mph. Thus, from the result, you cannot tell which vehicle had which acceleration. There are two ways to prove either creation or evolution. First, we could prove the cause of one or the other. Proving the existence of the Christian God, for example, would prove creation. God by His nature is holy and perfect. He does not lie. Therefore, when He claimed to have created the world, He did. On the other hand, we could prove the existence and operation of natural, physical forces capable of bringing about the world as it is. Both God and the physical forces would be proven in the same way - on the basis of their continuing work in this world. Second, we could prove creation or evolution by proving the existence of that which can only be accounted for by one of these and not by the other. For example, the incredible design of the universe points to an intelligent designer. Can evolution account for that design?";7;1;3;Creation

Think about it -- if evolution were true, then we should have flying apes shooting laser beams because this would be the most optimal way to survive. That's just one argument of many that shows how backwards evolution is. Another is the fact that dinosaur bones are here to test us. Also, God changed the speed of light recently so it seems like we're looking at planets and galaxies from a long time ago, but in reality it's just a test from God since he only wants the most devout in heaven and doesn't want to hang around with sinners because he's above that. Just thinking about it, there's so many reasons creationism is the way to go. Whenever I see a tree, or a pretty picture, it becomes obvious. When I open my Bible and get a fuzzy feeling, it's obvious. The fact that there's not fish running around with little legs should be the nail in the coffin but these stubborn evolutionists keep making up junk like transitional periods and all that.

Please show me the evidence of evolution. The great scientists, including Albert Einstein himself believed that the evidence in science points to a God. No one in their right mind would believe that a super advanced computer evolved by chance out of nothing. It was designed. And you evolutionists believe that our DNA, which is 100 million times more complex than a super advanced computer, evolved by chance?! You might want to rethink your theology. The DNA also gives information that can fill up the Grand Canyon 40 times over. In order to produce information, you need to have a valid source who knows the information himself.

1222;evolution;"What you say is exactly what I believe. Everything is evolving. It's called micro evolution. For example: dogs are a kind of animal with many different species of dogs within them. Bull dogs and great danes are different types of dogs, but they are still dogs. Even after breeding many dogs together, they came out with chihuahuas, which is a completely useless dog, but it is still a dog. Darwin found plenty of evidence for micro evolution. He noticed that depending on the island and habitats of the birds, the birds' beaks were made different. Each beak specialized and adapted to the area around them in order for them to survive. That was his only evidence. Humans also evolve through micro evolution. Tribes in Africa tend to have larger jaws than humans in America. The only reason is because the humans in Africa use their jaws more often to carry things, while humans in America have cars and other tools to carry things. This is micro evolution in the sense that their jaws adapted to the habitats around them. The evidence of micro evolution is everywhere. However, the evolution we all think of and debate upon is macro evolution. Macro evolution is an animal turning from one kind of animal to another. An example is a bird evolving into an alligator. That doesn't work and has never been proven. The evidence you just gave was all a part of micro evolution which is the result of animals evolving within their own kind.";7;1;3;Creation
1244;evolution;"CREATIONISM IS NOT SIMPLY AN ANCIENT STORY! For proof look at the Bible! See some of the stories that God and the Prophets tell, then compare those to things that are happening to-day! Evolution is in fact a story that is laughable! You just believe in evolution because you don't want to believe in God and other religions. You weak-minded soul! There is more proof than anything that God created the world in six days and that is that. Adam and Eve were tricked by the devil to sin against God and that is how sin came into the world. If new parts of evolution are always being added and discarded, then it is not the truth. The truth can not be changed! GOD DOES NOT CHANGE! Therefore creationism is the truth! There is almost no evidence supporting the evolutionary argument and the evidence that is there is fake and comical. Let me recite 2 Timothy 4:3 from the Holy Bible "For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear." I tell you, this is the truth. On and episode of "Hillbilly: The Real Story" on the History Channel, a priest in a church was talking about the people in his congregation that do not agree with his teachings, he said, "If you do not agree with me and my teachings, then go join a new congregation or go down the road and build your own church." That is exactly what 2 Timothy 4:3 is saying! Proof I tell you proof! The Theory of Evolution is not a fact. A scientific fact must be 100% correct. Failure to meet only one challenge proves the fact is wrong and therefore proving creationism right. This will prove that the Theory of Evolution fails many challenges, not simply one. And because it does, the only other option is that God is the ultimate creator. The Theory of Evolution will never become a law of science because it is wrought with errors. This is why it is a theory. The process of natural selection is not an evolutionary process. The DNA in plants and animals allows selective breeding to achieve desired results. Dogs are a good example of selective breeding. The DNA in all dogs has many recessive traits. A desired trait can be produced in dogs by selecting dogs with a particular trait to produce offspring with that trait. But you don't see dogs giving birth to humans. This is the same as the "survival of the fittest" theory of the evolutionists. Many different types of dogs can be developed this way, but they can never develop a human by selectively breeding dogs. Natural selection can never extend outside of the DNA limit. DNA cannot be changed into a new species by natural selection. It's not like whenever a person is born they "receive" DNA from their parents. God gives us DNA like a computer programmer types in code. A computer programmer doesn't create programs from other programs. It's all hand written, the same as the Bible. The same process of selective breeding is done with flowers, fruits, and vegetables. New variations of the species are possible, but a new species has never been developed by science. If Evolution were true, and using a lightning bolt and a mud puddle started life, Scientists would be able to create life easily. Evolutionist fail to admit that no species has ever been proven to have evolved in any way. Evolution is simply pie-in-the-sky conjecture without scientific proof. Genesis 1: 1-31 is perfect proof that creationism is correct, " 1 First God made heaven & earth 2 The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters. 3 And God said, "Let there be light", and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. 6 And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters." 7 And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. 8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day. 9 And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so. 10 God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good. 11 And God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth." And it was so. 12 The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day. 14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years, 15 and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so. 16 And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, he made the stars also. 17 And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth, 18 to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. 20 And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens." 21 So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth." 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. 24 And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so. 25 And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth." 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth." 29 And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit, you shall have them for food. 30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so. 31 And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day." Genesis 2: 1-8 describes how God made man: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2 And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done. 3 So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation. 4 These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 5 when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up--for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground, 6 but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground-- 7 then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being."

For example, giraffes. Giraffes have specially designed hearts to pump blood up their long necks, and neck valves that prevent too much blood from going to the brain. They would have died of high blood pressure every time they bent over to drink water if they didn't have these traits.

Many of them would say that it was the science itself that converted them from evolutionary thinking to creationism.";7;1;3;"No, I do not believe in evolution"
1842;evolution;"The Scientific Method The benefits from science are dramatic and widespread. By using scientific principles, man has pulled back the curtain of ignorance and advanced the quality of life for millions of people. With these achievements, science justifiably deserves a good reputation. Taking a closer look, the essence of science is the scientific method where a hypothesis is tested by experiment. That is, 1) State the question 2) Form a hypothesis 3) Do experiments 4) Interpret data and draw conclusions 5) Revise theory (go back to step 2) Instead of endless philosophical discussions to prove a point, experiment becomes the final arbitrator of truth - a successful approach. The issue becomes a bit sticky when discussing origins. How do we test the theory of evolution? We don't have the luxury of having a miniature universe with eons of time in the corner of a laboratory. So this leaves both evolutionists and creationists in same the boat. No absolute way to objectivity test their assertions. No eyewitnesses... Both are left to propose a model and then compare it with nature for consistency. Notice too, that good theories are falsifiable. Now consider the theory of evolution ... How can it be proved false? What fraction of the theory of evolution is open to invalidation, some small detail, or the entire principle? The approach seems to be, "look, you're here and there is no intelligent designer so evolution must be true!". Is this science or something else?";7;1;3;"No, I do not believe in evolution"
1842;evolution;"Evolutionists claim that life formed from non-life (dead chemicals), so-called "abiogenesis", even though it is a biological law ("biogenesis") that life only comes from life. The probability of the simplest imaginable replicating system forming by itself from non-living chemicals has been calculated to be so very small as to be essentially zero - much less than one chance in the number of electron-sized particles that could fit in the entire visible universe! Given these odds, is it reasonable to believe that life formed itself?";7;1;3;"No, I do not believe in evolution"

To recap: 'Gravity' is NOT a theory. It is 'observed phenomenon'. There are currently several scientific theories of how gravity works..... A 'theory' is a VERY rigidly defined term that refers to a VERY rigidly defined description of reality. A theory is NEVER the reality itself, nor does it have any pretentions of being that.

2532;evolution;"Lucy is not actually proof of evolution, the bones produced too many problems upon further study (e.g., it was probably male, it probably walked on its knuckles, and generally evidences ape-like qualities, not human). It appears to have actually been the bones of an extinct species of chimpanzee. Human DNA is similar to an apes (and a dogs, and a cats, and a number of other mammals), but this does not constitute any proof. In fact, since evolution requires more advanced species have greater complexity, this would indicate the horse is more evolved than human (more chromosomes). This actually highlights a problem with evidence (on both sides, I'd imagine). Individuals tend to force biases into evidence. Mammoth is good example (turns out, not woolly and had tropical food in its stomach, which kind of rules out "lived during ice age").";7;1;3;Creationism
2532;evolution;"Why I doubt evolution (besides, of course, my obvious worldview): Propagation would require two identically evolved creatures (at least in advanced creatures - male and female). Genetic differences would make them incompatible mates. Besides which, genetic deviations tend to significantly impair fertility (as with Downs syndrome). Some species could not adapt their adaptations. Here's the general idea: a fish doesn't start breathing air. If its next generation did, it would quickly die (because it was born in water were fish live, not air), so not propagate. I realize there are creatures, that do both, but captures the idea of the problem with adaptations in general (not fish specifically). This relates to a host of actual adaptations in many species. This introduces yet a third point. Why adapt anyway? What motivates evolution? Fish don't indicate a dissatisfaction with water, they have no drive to breathe. Do they adapt to a new environment? But how could they have enough time in a new environment to propagate before they die? If such were the case then we could see many forms of evolution currently happening. There are, of course, many more problems with evolution, but citing them all would be tedious, and honestly, unnecessary. You can look them up on your own if you want to.";7;1;3;Creationism
1529;evolution;"Having completed a rebuttal on the opposing side, I feel compelled to pass judgement on this debate because of something that occurred to me while I was writing it, this debate doesn't really work properly. Evolution and Creationism are not mutually exclusive by any means. Yes, the world and everything in it may well have been created by a force outside (or beyond) the planet itself, rather than it being a random sequence of events. I myself believe that it is improbable to suggest that something as incredibly complex and interdependent as a planet capable of supporting life could have developed purely through chance. However, now that its here (the method by which it arrived aside) does that mean that everything within it is fixed, and controlled in every aspect by the same non-worldly means that brought the world into being? Thethinker is perfectly correct when he questions (rhetorically I assume) whether or not evolution can be an agent of creation. This debate then could lead us to (at least) four different theories to discuss: 1. The world was created by an external power, and everything within it is controlled by an external power, there is no such thing as evolution (akin to an 'intelligent design' argument). 2. The world was created with evolution built in - the natural evolution we experience is in fact how external creationary influence functions. 3. The world was created by an external power, and left rolling - evolution happens by chance and without design. 4. The world, evolution and everything else in the world came about by chance and there is no external influence. Now, personally I'm a believer in argument 3. Asimpleman seems to have made his posts in favour of argument 1. Member4629's post could have applied to any one of arguments 2, 3 and 4. Here's the problem, The only true counterargument to 'Evolution is true' is argument 1. and the only true counterargument to 'Creation is true' is argument 4.

1529;evolution;""I should have said "which deserves more credence" or "which is a more conclusive theory" or something like that." Ah - now this is an interesting question! Interesting mostly in the sense that the two theories are based of a widely separate degree of evidence - evolution is a theory based on observational data, whilst creationism is based on the lack of measurable data. In a sense, this in itself provides us with an academically acceptable answer when Occam's Razor is applied. For observational data to be accepted as testament truth (pun intended) then we must make an array of assumptions, that data is gathered correctly, that it was interpreted in an unbiased manner, that hereditary characteristics and genetics in general function in the way we believe them to, etc... Compare this to the foundations of a 'creationism' theory thus, Either the world was created by an outside influence, or it was not. Things cannot bring themselves into existence. We must assume that with lack of evidence to suggest that the universe could have brought itself into existence, something outside the world carried out the process. Note, in particular, the idea that 'things cannot bring themselves into existence' - this is based almost purely on Aristotle's 4 causes, which dictates that the process that brings something into being (the efficient cause) cannot be the same thing as the substance it is made of, the form it takes or its purpose for which it came into being (these being the other three causes). Since these four causes together are the only influences that can bring something into existence, it seems the only option left to us is that the world cannot have been created under its own volition, and thus there must have been an outside influence. The application of Occam's Razor then, in order to accept the idea of evolution we must make a great number of assumptions (as has been discussed) but for creation only one (that of the efficacy of Aristotle's logical reasoning). Since the razor requires that when evidence cannot decide the superior theory alone (and as I have written at great length, it is impossible to do so in this case) the theory requiring the least number of assumptions is preferable, we must declare Creationism the winner, if only by the laws of academic logic. I stress that this is certainly not the only way of approaching the problem, and by no means a conclusive argument - merely the first one that occurred to me.";7;1;3;Creationism
2532;evolution;"When I talk about identically evolved creatures, I mean in a significant addition to the genetic material. The types of changes evolution suggests could only be maintained by two creatures with the same genetic design. Otherwise, we'd all be genetically "backward compatible". While your explanation of natural selection was nice, I think you may have entirely missed my point on the matter of motivation. Fish live in water. There is not reason for them to be on land (no advantage). In fact for a fish to breathe air is detrimental (fish dies). So not only does natural selection not apply, it argues that said fish would not evolve because the "evolved" creature could not survive its environment. The water going fish has the advantage (it doesn't die). Fish, by the way, are only my means of illustrating the problem (so I wasn't highlight a flaw). There are many, many creatures whose survival hinges on particular biologies or behaviors (adaptations in evolution-speak). The problem is that said adaptation could not be adapted because said creature needs it to survive anyway.";7;1;3;Creationism
1529;evolution;""DOES NOT say that IT is TRUE." I don't believe I claimed it was - I hope that by alluding to the level of assumptions that must be made for it to be accepted as truth (or, okay, to be acknowledged as the most likely situation based on current evidence) I implied that it's efficacy was entirely baseless when compared to the quasi-mathematical truth that is logic. "DOES NOT claim that the driving mechanism of change is random chance." In this statement, you are right, the process of natural selection is not random chance. However, what I was doing when using that statement was trying to rebut the argument of someone who seemed to be under the impression that there was a concious decision made somewhere (by the creatures themselves possibly?) to change in a way that made them more suitable for a different environment. I was making the point that variation between individual organisms is random - your eye colour, hair height etc are not based on natural selection as compared to your parents (direct ancestry), merely by chance. If it makes you more suited to your environment than the next man, that is also chance. We call this combination of coincidences 'natural selection', and together they form a process that is predictable and logically acceptable, not random. But the truth is that the variation and situation that causes natural selection to occur is entirely random. The driving change of adaption and evolution is not random, but the events that allow adaption to occur are. "DOES NOT claim that humans have evolved FROM apes." That's true. But of course, I can only be seen to have claimed that this wasn't the case if you assume that I was using the word 'human' to mean 'not an ape'. 'Human' is a type of ape, which evolved from another type of ape, which evolved from another type of ape... Actually that's misleading, rather it's a continuous line of 'ape' without being able to pinpoint 'this is one kind' and 'this another', they're all very slightly different. 'Human' just happens to be the name that we apply to this kind of ape which we categorise by a particular set of rules, in the same sense that 'ape' is just the name we give to a certain type of mammal because it fits another, slightly less specific set of rules. "it is misguided to think that 'creationism' (fundamentalist, few K years old-Earth version) is an accurate description" I agree, but this alone is not an effective argument against 'creationism' in general. Also, the fact that evolution is a more readily observable in fact weakens it's credibility, as expressed in my previous argument.

Johnson is admitting that evolution IS consistent with the evidence, but only as long as that evidence is considered in non-supernatural terms. In other words, you have to invoke the supernatural to poke holes in evolution. Since science explicitly repudiates the supernatural, that's game, set, match for evolution as a scientific theory.

Considering that the changing is the entire point of the theory, major fail. Also, there is a thing in the theory of evolution called "the x factor" or "x force." It is an algebraic x that refers to the force that is driving evolution. More importantly though, the x factor refers to what is making these animals "need" to change and then thusly transform. This force could be called "mother nature" or "god." Considering that those two forces have no place in the theory, another major fail. Here is the third and most important major fail: The theory of evolution says that animals transform or gradually change over time because of a "need" or "ability" to sruvive. Mathemetically speaking, Humans are the only species that change over time because they feel they need to. You cant "need" something unless you are conscious, because needing is a sensation that is acted upon. Humans have the ability to accept or deny a need, totally unique to them. Animals just do what their entire species is programmed to do. Therefore when they "need" something its not really needing, just doing.

1485;evolution;"You say evolution is a fact, but which one are you talking about? I'm assuming you are talking about Macro Evolution, but I'll talk about Micro Evolution as well. First lets talk about micro evolution. Micro Evolution is the adaption and changes within species. Birds are examples of this. Depending on where they live, certain birds have larger and stronger beaks so they can crack the larger nuts open. Other birds have longer, but skinnier beaks so they can fit there beaks into smaller areas. They don't need the large beaks because of where they live. The seeds are smaller where they live, so therefore they don't need large beaks. Micro Evolution is a proven fact. We always see certain changes within the species. Macro Evolution however, is the addition of new traits or the transition to a new specie. An example is a dinosaur evolving into a bird. Dinosaurs are reptiles which have nothing to do with birds. They changes into a totally different specie. This is never observed and cannot be proven. So don't say it's a fact when they can't even observe it.";7;0;3;Creationism
3312;evolution;"Well, you certainly took your time showing up to this discussion, but all comments are always welcome. Yes, change over time. That's all. Got it. But There is a domino effect that is implied and it is a bit nitpicky to seperate that from the discussion and state that those making reference to the domino effect are being ignorant somehow. Within the scientific scheme you have (predominantly) the Big Bang which is supposed to explain how a fertile sphere such as earth might come about to begin with. At that point something very unscientific happens aka life begins from non-life. At that point evolution takes over. All of this falls into one big sphere called naturalism where both material and biology do basically the same thing, improve or become more complex and functional over time. That is the reason for the mincing of words that seems to upset you, yet there is nothing in there that takes the role or modus operandi for granted or sees it ignorantly. It is a scientific theory, yes, but one that becomes more problematic with every single one of the thousands of publications you reference. Scientific FACTS continuously muddy the waters of evolution and it exists not like gravity as something we see in action but more like philosophy that can be visualized and religiously held. The genome does not increase in information, but its potential decreases over time. Species may adapt, but that adaptation is always drawn from genetic information that is already present in the DNA of said species. At no time does adaptation involve the acquisition of genetic information. Once a Species adapts thoroughly or is bred thoroughly, like a beagle, then future generations beyond that species will no longer possess the potential to exhibit traits that its great grand parents did. When you read some of Darwins assumptions about observing animal breeding you realize that he was writing in an age prior to the work of Gregor Mendel who had not published his genetic studies yet. Most of the breakthrough work regarding thermaldynamics was also not published at that time. DNA had not been discovered nor the atom nor an even rudimentary understanding into the complexity of "Simple cells". Had Darwin tried to publish 50 years later it would have been laughed at, but to many chips were on the table by that time due to the desire to shed religion at all costs and not because of compelling facts. There are no compelling facts to support evolution, only compelling arguments born of dislike of the idea of God. Many many many facts support adaptation and changes that diminish the future potential of a species, but nothing that works the way it is assumed evolution should. Unlike gravity, we cannot and have never witnessed a single incident of true evolution (in the progressive, non diminshing sense).";7;0;3;Creationism
3312;evolution;"THIS IS A REBUTTAL TO “JULIAN 1” WHOSE POST DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE SITE BUT WAS AUTO SENT TO MY EMAIL. J1: Before I begin I first want to say evolution is not a belief for those who diminish the belief of god, that is absolutely not true. ATLAS: The vast majority of the time it is, in fact, the very vehicle for all disregard, and snubbing, of anything even remotely religious. A few try to play in both playgrounds but as the most studied elements of each side of the fence will tell you it is almost an embarrassment to think that they are compatible… although very American in its desire to think the middle ground is where the truth is. This issue is a sidebar none the less and agree to disagree. J1: Darwin himself was a very religious man, I mean, Darwin's name is in one of the most famous catholic churches in England. ATLAS: Irrelevant. There are plenty of evolution fans who would take you to task on this. I don’t necc. Care as it does not determine the nature, truth, or value of his theories. J1: The Roman Catholic Church officially adopted and have accepted Darwin’s idea of the theory of evolution as a scientifically accurate theory. ATLAS: The Catholic Church is not a great source for scientific validation and it is historically known for its compliance with popular norms. i.e. The bible is more flexible to the Church than is Shakespeare or any other great work and is not really viewed as “The Word of God”… unless the word of the majority is the word of god. But again, not really relevant and agree to disagree. J1: So evolution is 100% absolutely not for those who don't believe in god. I believe in god. ATLAS: Understood. And agree. But while I have never met Richard Dawkins and would disagree with him vehemently about a great many things, we would both agree that individuals in this category are watering down both and have not analyzed their positions very deeply. To say one “believes in god” (lowercase “g” noted) is an easy thing to say. Most Americans who throw out that statement have approached the idea of god as if it were the shelves of Walmart or a buffet. We see the selections and put together a cart or a plate that meets with our tastes, preferences, and outlook. Occasionally we challenge ourselves with something new that we are not certain of and either keep it or discard it. The end result is a “god” who is nothing more than a mirror image of ourselves or a supernatural alter ego who basically agrees with us on everything. But because we are Americans we do not call this Narcissism or blind pride, we call it open mindedness and non-fundamentalism. J1: Another thing, we cannot take the theory of the big bang and put in the same realm of evolution when they're not even in the same realm of the science world. Evolution is biology, the big bang is astronomy. ATLAS: Yes, I already covered this. Turn the clock backwards and watch the process of evolution roll back in time. What happens then? We watch the process of stellar evolution work backwards to the big bang. The two work together to create a storyline from an ancient nothingness to this moment. They share many fundamentals to include that they are both in the realm of science as a whole but primarily the fundamental idea that God has never been nor will ever be necc. for any of it. (Of course we can see nothing with regard to life emerging from Non-life because it defies all known observation and experimentation.) J1: You said that we cannot see evolution happening as we speak such as we can for gravity, well that's actually not true. It is a proven fact that simple creatures such as (invertabrates, plants, bacteria) were one earth long before complex creatures, ATLAS: “Proven fact”. Interesting. I notice you are very fond of the gravity thing. Drop a pen and confirm gravity. What can you see to confirm evolution? Nothing. Except of course the dreams of Charles Lyell. As a contemporary of Darwin he created the initial diagram of layers of the earth and the sorts of creatures that should be found within. This was not based upon any field findings or data but pure theory about what SHOULD BE there. The logical necessity of this diagram was quickly understood and a deviation from its basics would result in catastrophic failure for Darwin’s acceptance. Now the data comes in and the data has always, in a very general sense, ordered itself as you make reference to. The trouble is the fact that you have been taught a generalized state of affairs with the not so anomalous anomalies removed. There are places where a single tree fossil cuts through millions of years of layers. There are places where human artifacts are intermingled in the Jurassic or older. There are places where it is even upside down. These are brushed aside by academics because they have to have logical explanations and then students are given the white wash. The process by which both organic and material are settled in the course of a flood are much more in line with the data and pretty much explain all phenomenon associated with what is actually found. Here are some actual facts which are void of philosophical innuendo. As with all actual facts and observable phenomenon, they do not conflict with the Bible. The oldest tree is measured in thousands of years. The oldest river delta is measured in thousands of years. The oldest coral reef is measured in thousands of years. Dozens of elements which increase at regular rates in the world’s oceans only clock back thousands of years. The magnetosphere declines in strength at a constant rate. Clock it back more than 100,00 years and the earth is like living in a microwave. The moon recedes at a constant rate. Move it back more than 250,000 years and the earth is torn apart by the gravitational effects. There is no such thing as a vestigial anything. There are only genes and organs which we do not yet fully understand. The classification of vestigial is superimposed as a proof of evolution until some researcher discovers a breakthrough and the former vestigial becomes essential. This is one area were ignorance of something is used as a proof of evolution. This also hampers research as that which is vestigial is written off. The appendix is one such example. Preventative surgeries were performed on infants that removed this appendix on the basis that its vestigial nature was more trouble than it was worth. Low and behold it was discovered that the organ is essential for infant immunity development. Now that’s good science. J1: it's impossible to assume that over 100 million years complex creatures magically appeared. ATLAS: Why not. In the realm of science the emergence of life itself is basically magic. But, see above. J1: Vestigial structures aren't accidents or coincidences, ATLAS: Isn’t everything in the realm of evolution accident and coincidence? Or are you actually an ID fan? J1: The bone structure of a human arm and that of a shrew are almost identical… Atlas: Got it. Know where you’re going here. Note the similarities in Davinci’s works, or Van Gogh, or Mozart, or Einstein, or Hemingway. A common creator renders common features and fingerprints. J1: We need to keep in mind the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The principle states that in order for NO evolution to occur, there must be no genetic mutations (which happen all the time)… ATLAS: Which part of the equation accounts for the fact that mutations are bad and destructive? I guess according to that equation it would be n the interest of humanity to move as many people around Chernobyl in order to accelerate “God’s process” of progress. The rest of your thought on this only demonstrates the importance of ALREADY EXISTING GENES to interplay in order to broaden the canvas. But again, no new colors are being created, just mixing and expanding of already existing ones. J1: Why do giraffes have long necks and live in environments where their food source is high up in the tress... Why do lizards have the ability to camouflage and live in environments filled with predators… ATLAS: Your premise is that random chance and accident produces superior results than purposeful creation according to a plan by a super intellect, even though everything within the realm of life and science proves opposite. In case you missed it, the answer is, creatures made according to a specific plan would exhibit that result. Chance events, or anything left to natural processes will decay and become more inefficient. J1: Does this mean god doesn't exist? ATLAS: I would say it is part of the evidence FOR God. J1: Many religions understand why evolution just makes perfect sense, and have decided that evolution is god’s way bringing new organisms to earth, changing our world. ATLAS: Oh, Chaos and death and fruitless pain are god’s way of doing business. Praise god. Perfect sense? Despite contradicting so many scientific principles and everyday observations, really? You are correct though, in surmising that evolution is only possible by supernatural intervention, i.e. every step forward would be a miracle. The fact that many religions have thrown in the towel to have a better looking store front for the customers is unimportant. This only indicates that some religions don’t understand the facts and implications as well as they should. J1: I took a few classes about evolution in college. There was a girl in the class who sat next to me who took the class to try and prove to everyone that evolution was completely false, she was so enlightened by the course, her mindset went from evolution doesn't exist, to evolution is gods change over time. ATLAS: Again, praise that wonderful god of pointless pain. And for every story you present of a convert I can give you a story of an Atheistic or agnostic PHD in various scientific disciplines who, due to the evidentiary discrediting of evolution and big bang, became born again Christians. Such a discussion is round and round and pointless. I am fully aware of the probability analysis that keeps the imagination of evolution alive in the minds of so many. I know that a number can be found to describe the odds of one trillion six sided dice being rolled such that all six sided dice show a “one”. Given enough time anything is possible. Trouble is, no amount of rolls will give any of those six sided dice a face of “seven”. That is the sort of probability that evolution is up against when real scientific “laws” of physics, chemistry, and biology are brought to bear.";7;0;3;Creationism

The implications here are interesting. This would mean that we are not limited to seeking something that we cannot find (i.e., some god-figure), but we instead focus on searching for some extra-terrestrial being that we can perceive and is well within the realm of scientific investigation.

3879;evolution;"I have read your entire argument. You do hold quite a strong argument in a lot of regions, but I see a problem at the beginning. You define a theory as, and I quote, "an explanation of concept/idea that is supported by evidence and/or many experiments/trials and is widely accepted by the scientific community." A fair enough definition, and one I will not dispute. The problem lies with your application of your definition. You are right to apply it to the matter of intelligent design, but grow lax when it comes to the matter of evolution. By your own admission, evolution is an idea based on observation. However, there is no evidence to support your claim. For the sake of my own definitions, I do not mean microevolution, in which a species favors one genetic trait over another. Rather, I refer to macroevolution, in which a leap is made from one species to another. There is no method to experiment or test the concept, either. As a result, by following the remainder of your reasoning, evolution suffers the same judgment as intelligent design. Both should end up in a religious studies classroom. Either the definition of theory must somehow distinguish the two ideas, or both are committed to the same classroom. In the latter case, one cannot fairly denote one evolution to one field of study and intelligent design to another. If the former is true, then you must form a new definition of the word "theory".";7;0;3;"ID should be taught."
3879;evolution;"Having read your sources cited, I have a question: where is the evidence? You have facts, but these facts are subject to interpretation. Rather than giving evidence of evolution, these are facts that the theory of evolution hopes to explain, but contain no actual proof. These same facts could be wielded by one who believes in intelligent design, but in either case, these facts are not conclusive evidence. For example, the fossils could be damaged or tampered with. Even if they are genuine, they do not prove that evolution occurred. At best they prove that a species died off. This, once again, leaves evolution on the same field as intelligent design.";7;0;3;"ID should be taught."
3879;evolution;"Respectfully, carbon dating has problems. For example, it has dated such incidents as Mount St. Helens and Hawaii’s expanding sections of islands (referring to that which have witnessed the volcanic creation) quite inaccurately. One might argue that carbon dating is inaccurate for short periods of time, but it begs the question why we should believe it is accurate for greater periods of time. With this in mind, you have yet to prove more than survival of the fittest and microevolution. Your example, for the sake of argument, has proven that tail length is helpful for survival of a species, and as such, that trait is favored. You have yet to show that it changed species. The only difference is that a genetic trait has become popular. And there are skulls? Really, skulls that have actually been validated, that have not been discarded as fraud, as so many have? (which is what my comment of tampering referred to.) Skulls that are not of other primates?";7;0;3;"ID should be taught."
3879;evolution;"I shall address your response paragraph by paragraph, as to ensure clarity. Do I understand you correctly? Carbon dating is inaccurate for recent dates that have been observed and can be verified without the application of science, but is highly accurate at dates we have precious little verifying means? Pardon me, but if a system does not work when one can easily verify it, I find it difficult to believe that it works when verification is less present. Microevolution and macroevolution are hardly the same thing, hence the opposing prefixes. By googling, “observed instances of speciation”, the article does little more than a fly version of Mendel’s pea plants, thereby establishing dominant and recessive genetic traits. What does that have to do with your point? The same question applies to your comment about Larus gulls. And back to the matter of skulls. What are the skulls that you speak of, and how do they validate evolution? Are there skulls that demonstrate a species in the midst of evolution and not simply an extinct species? Is it intact? I raise that latter question because I notice often the skulls I observe are formed from a jawbone and a few more fragmented pieces, with guesswork and theories filling in the empty spaces. Could you at least cite, possibly explain, something more specific before you decide my intelligence is faulty? Lastly, you have provided more than enough to read, but very little to support yourself.

First off, let’s not make the mistake of separating the metaphysical hypothesis from the scientific hypothesis. After all, if it were to be discovered that oh, let’s say a slice of cheese caused the universe to be in existence, then that would be considered science. Even if the earth did just “poof” into existence, there is still a science to it, just like there is a science to a simple blink of an eye. It seems, Rationalist, that the big bang theory came about due to part that science can trace events back in time only to a certain point. At that point, there is a barrier that cannot be pushed. Far from supporting the naturalism, big bang theory says that there is a limit to how far back the earth’s origins go, proving that time, space, and matter were created at a finite point in time. So, it is not contrary to believe in both the big bang and creationism. It is simply the same idea being sold under two different labels. Scarleta – Wonderful observation. Supposing we take up the idea that there is a finite beginning to our universe, then that means something from outside our universe had to do with it coming into existence. So let’s use your example that God is the source from outside our universe and that he spoke it into existence. The idea that God must have a beginning seems logical. But let’s say we discover that God did have a beginning, and that we found God’s creator. Then what question would we have to ask? Who created God’s creator! And back and back and back and back we go. Even our great grandchildren wouldn’t live to see the results. But suppose time, space and matter were created by one being. Think about it… time: created. Time assembled and put together like a clock itself. What’s outside of time? Nothing. And certainly not time. In order to create something, you must be outside its element. Therefore, God would not be constricted to the laws of time. This makes Him eternal. And what about space? The place in which we move around, drive, fly, spin, and jump? What if that whole concept was created as well? If God created space (including outer space), he would not be limited to certain locations or pinpointed on a GPS because He could hold space in his hand as if I were to hold a seashell. This would make God omnipresent. And matter? Nothing’s the matter to a God who could assemble atoms together and construct the intricacies of DNA molecules. So as for the poofing not being a valid explanation for the beginning of the universe, or at least not to consider it, makes no sense to me. I think it’s every bit as valid as any other theory. The only question is, which theory makes the most sense and holds up the most weight in the end? As for the big bang, like I told Rationalist, it certainly gives proof to creationism, but the theory tries to avoid the idea of a creator. Jonjax71 – To my memory, the exploding/expanding idea was first introduced (or at least made popular) by a man named Carl Sagan in his science program called Cosmos. He suggested that the explosion that caused our universe was only one in a series – that the universe is expanding today but will one day reverse itself and will begin a process of contracting until it is once again a tiny point, then it will explode again, starting the entire process over, like an accordion opening and closing. But this runs up against one of the basic laws of physics: Even an oscillating universe would use up the available energy in each cycle, and it would eventually run down. The second law of thermodynamics, the law of decay, shoots down any notion of an eternal universe.";7;1;3;Creationism
136;evolution;"I never got the whole "Video Blog" thing. It always seems to me like its a venue to be arrogant with shades of egotism (but thats just me). I do find it interesting that you are so readily willing to accept "The Big Bang produced both SPACE and TIME. There was NOTHING outside the big bang and there was NOTHING before it either." This is interesting because accepting that quote from your "Vlog" (or whatever they call it nowadays) brings about the exact same philosophical consequences as creationism does. Its the same old tired rebuttal, "If God created the Universe, then what created God?". Well if you dont believe in God how is it that you can say there was NOTHING before the big bang? What created all of the things in your balloon? I personally accept the idea that there are things that have always been and always will be, things without a beginning and an end. I'm just confused because It seems to me that you are not against the notion of things "poofing" into existence, but you are against it when anyone suggests there may have been a "poofer" (one who does the poofing) which is totally contradictory to your quote.";7;1;3;Creationism
2808;evolution;"To the contrary! The Big Bang has only half cooked theories and complicated explanations which really make no sense. For example, the formation of man is suggested to be a process called 'abiogenesis', which is a largely improbably formation of living cell matter from inanimate matter. It makes more logical sense for us all to be created. Remember, the human being is complex - even more complex than a chimpanzee. The world and animals are made entirely differently - how could each one be different if we were all created by the same ameoba? Why weren't some animals bypassed to get directly to us? How'd they all form with nary a one being missed? There's so many holes in Evolution that I don't see how 'proof' could be provided.";7;1;3;Creationism

136;evolution;""There is no "poof" in the big bang." Fully ware of this. The "poof" was just a metaphor. I could have also said something like "What lit the wick that was the creation of the universe?" "The "no time before the big bang" position is not philosophical. It is a matter of mathematics" Not true. There are plenty of courses at even the most basic Universities and Community colleges that discuss the real life consequences of various mathematical theories and proofs to prove my point. "So the question, "what happened before the big bang?" is meaningless on more than one level. (a) we have no way of knowing, (b) the mathematics says that time itself didn't exist before the big bang, and (c) it's not clear that the question actually makes sense in the first place." (a) Surely out of curiosity alone, something as important and mind blowing as the beginning of existence would be one of the most meaningful things ever right? It is also very strange to hear "We have no way of knowing" from so many athiests. To me it just seems like an excuse, an attempted shortcut. "What made the Universe and how was it done? Well we'll most likely never know so dont even worry your pretty little head about it". For someone who places so much value in science (as well you should) it seems very contradictory to think that way. Humanity should be (and is) constantly learning about anything and everything within our universe, saying "we have no way of knowing" is cutting our species way short. (b) and (c) I was actually going to write a rebuttal to this but i realized that i agree with you. Time and Space are limitations within our universe so (and this is where the Theism comes in) couldn't it be said that something, "God" will call it, that created the universe and all of its "things" and put them into a system that is constantly expanding and contracting would BY DEFINITION have to exist outside of that system and not be bound my the laws of space and time? I know thats a loaded question and brings about a plethora of other questions to go along with it, but i'll ask it nonetheless. ----------------------------------------- I'd just like to thank you DKTurner for FINALLY giving me the chance to have an intelligent and respectable discussion about God. You're using arguments that i rarely see and you're doing it in a way that puts neither of us on the defensive. THESE are the kinds of discussions that i would love to see.

Sadly most of them use the same old, tired, and weak arguments (from both sides) that make them instantly unbearable. Thank you sir.";7;1;3;Creationism
1485;evolution;"I believe in young earth creationism. Anything that exists in time had to have had a beginning. Anything that begins to exist has a cause. If there is a car accident that begins, everybody knows that the accident had a cause. Since we know that everything has a beginning and everything that begins has a cause, there could be only two things that could have caused it to happen. They are either personal things or impersonal things. Impersonal things are something like earthquakes, tornadoes, or anything that causes destruction. Since we have life, we know that the cause wasn't impersonal, so it to have been a personal cause. Someone had to have created this Universe. This doesn't prove Christianity (even though I am a Christian) but it does show there had to have been a creator who created the Universe.";7;1;3;Creationism

An example is a dag changing into a non dog, like a bird or cat. So when you say science proves evolution, which evolution are you talking about, and if it is macro evolution you are talking about, then show me some of the scientific examples that you say prove it.";7;1;3;Creationism
1485;evolution;"First off, none of them give me any proof that these bones/species are our ancestors, and how can they tell how old these bones are? They're just bones they find in the dirt. Also, I said that everything that exists in time has to have a beginning. God is outside of time. And the fact that the Universe has not reached equilibrium yet proves that the Universe had a beginning. And your Big Bang theory, where did the dirt come from? Also, the big bang was a ball of dirt spinning faster and faster and finally exploded. The pieces of course flew off and became the galaxies, stars, etc. If the ball was spinning counter-clockwise, then shouldn't the pieces flown off also be spinning counter-clockwise? If that is so, then why is Venus, Neptune's moon, and other planets and moons out there spin clockwise? Which is backwards from all the other planets. All the planets, moons, stars, and galaxies have to be spinning the same direction if the Big Bang was true.";7;1;3;Creationism
1485;evolution;"You tell me to look up these fossils, molecular biology, etc, and say these prove evolution, but these aren't proof for evolution at all. I will now give you evidence that evolution can't be true. 1. I'll start off by talking about fossils. First of all, if evolution is true, then we shouldn't have any trouble finding these missing link fossils. In over millions of year there should be millions of missing link fossils, but there isn't. Darwin himself even stated that. Once in a great while though, scientists will say they found a missing link. The assumptions they make of course when they find these rare fossils are that the bones did not get distorted, and the animal or human wasn't originally born distorted. But even after all this time, there are still no fossils records that prove evolution. David Raup is a scientist who has a huge fossil collection admits that there are no fossil records for evolution. Dr. Colin Paterson is another scientist that wrote an evolution book called "Darwin's Enigma". He didn't give any fossil record proof in his book and later on stated that there are no fossil record for evolution. There are other evolution scientists that admit there are no fossil records for evolution: Dr. D. Berlinski, Dr. Stephen J. Gould, etc. Remember that these scientists I just mentioned are looking for missing links, and have a huge collection of fossils. Over millions of fossils. Biology itself isn't proof for evolution. According to the evolution scientists the chimpanzee is our closest relative. The genetic difference between a human and a chimpanzee is only 1.6%. So it is 98.4% the same as a human. Although 1.6% difference may seam small, it is really a huge difference. The gap in 1.6% is 48,000,000 nucleotides. According to science a change of 3 nucleotides is fatal to any kind of animal or human. So a chimpanzee couldn't have evolved in a time of millions of years, otherwise it would have died. Saying that we are ancestors to any kind of monkey or ape because we are so similar to them is just as ridiculous as this, clouds are 100% water, watermelons are 97% water, and jellyfish are 98% water. Since they are so similar, they are each others ancestors and are related to each other. This is plain and simply ridiculous. Another scientific example that proves evolution can't be true is the bacterium flagellum. Evolution says that we all evolved from bacteria. Without bacteria we could not live. The bacterium flagellum motor is the motor on a bacteria that enables it to be able to move around and get from place to place. Irreducible Complexity is a term used to explain a machine so complex that if you take one thing away from it, the entire machine doesn't work. An example is a mouse trap or a car motor. If you take one thing away from mouse trap like the hammer, or piston from a car motor, the entire thing doesn't work. You need all the things at one time in order for them to work. This is the same with the bacterium flagellum motor. If you take one thing away from it then the entire thing doesn't work. You need all the parts at one time in order for it to work. This shows it couldn't have evolved in over millions of years, otherwise the motor would not work and the bacteria would die. In this case, all life would not exist. Carbon dating along with radiometric dating do not work. Scientists dated two parts of one mammoth, and both of them turned out to be different ages. One part of the mammoth turned out to be over 15,000 years old while another part of the same mammoth turned out to be over 21,000 years old. This of course isn't true. Living mollusk shells have been carbon dated to be 2300 years old. Another freshly killed seal was carbon dated to be 1300 years old. Even a living snail was carbon dated to be 27,000 years old. All of these of course can't be true. 2. What I meant by "God is outside of time" is that God is not bound by time. He himself invented time, but is intricately involved with his creation. It is impossible for me to prove this to you unless you have an open mind or your already a Christian. 3. Now, I'll first give you an example first and then explain it to you. If I left a hot cup of coffee in a room, it will eventually become the temp. of the room. This is called equilibrium. The stars, the moon, the planets, etc. are all still different temperatures. Some are hotter than others. If the universe didn't have a beginning, then everything would be the same temp. as the room it's in(universe). Yes, the star and planets have fuel to keep them hot, but the fuel will run out eventually. This is just to prove that the universe did have a beginning. 4. First off, my school doesn't even allow me to use wikipedia as a site to search for any of my projects because some of the information in wikipedia is false. Anyone can write some kind of information in it. But there are text books out there that say the big bang was a gathering of all the matter in the universe into a ball and exploded. The universe from there began to expand. Some text books are "Prentice Hall General Science" and "Prentice Hall Earth Science". 5. I forgot to ask you this question in my last post. Thanks for reminding me. So where did the energy come from? 6. As for Venus, do you know what it will take to reverse the spin of a planet? Whatever hit it must have been large enough to completely destroy it. It should have at least left some kind of marking or dent, but Venus is a perfectly round planet. 7. The arguments I come up with are legit arguments that question the evolution theory. al to an animal";7;1;3;Creationism
1485;evolution;"Your arrogance blinds you to the truth. I'm not going to make a huge essay like my last post, so I'll just say all I have to say in a shorter simpler essay. First, I looked up Ken Miller on youtube and his argument of these things being able to function separately from each other is a good theory. I wouldn't doubt it at all if they can function without each other. But, you still need all the parts of the motor at one time, in their proper alignment for the motor itself to work. Ken Miller himself stated in the video that though the parts of the flagellum are functional on their own, it's still not a flagellum unless they are all together in their proper places. Otherwise the bacteria again will just sit there and die. Now I am assuming you understand how carbon dating works, so I won't bother explaining it, but right now I can show you that carbon dating proves the earth is less than 30,000 years old. We know that carbon14 comes in the atmosphere at the same time carbon14 is leaking out of the atmosphere. The thing that scientists tried to figure out was how long will it take for the earth to reach equilibrium. In other words, how long will it take for a new born earth to receive the same amount of carbon14 as it is losing carbon14? After a while they calculated that a new born earth will reach equilibrium in about 30,000 years. If evolution is true and the earth is over billions of years old, then we should have reached equilibrium billions of years ago. But, radioactive carbon is still forming 28-37% faster than it is decaying, which means the earth is less than 30,000 years old. On your 3rd point, remember I was just trying to point out the Universe had a beginning. It does not prove the the age of the Universe at all. And even if the early matter of the universe was just hydrogen, then where did all the hydrogen come from? If I told you I believe God created everything, you would ask me "where did God come from"? But yet you don't know where the hydrogen came from. So I believe in the beginning God and you believe in the beginning Matter/hydrogen. Having a creator in control of the Universe sounds a lot more comforting. We are on a ball spinning around through space at very high speeds. In just our galaxy alone there is only about a 2% chance for life to even exist. The percentage for life to begin in the Universe is so small they cannot calculate it. If the earth goes off track just a little bit, we will all be die. It is a good thing knowing someone is in charge of this universe. You said that Venus rebuilds its surface every few hundred thousand years. How do you know that? Has anyone had a telescope a few hundred thousand years ago to be able to examine it themselves? You cannot prove something without being able to examine it yourself. I'm giving you statistics and science that are able to be examined and proven. You aren't giving me any good science. There is no way you can examine something that supposedly happened over hundreds of thousands of years ago, or even millions of years ago. Next time you read something that they claim happened millions of years ago, ask yourself the question "how do they know, and how did they figure that out"?";7;1;3;Creationism

After all of the evidence is presented each student could explain what they believe and why they believe it. I see no reason why any competent teacher would not be able to lead such a discussion. The course would be highly controversial and a great many people from all sides would complain about the others giving bad information and accusations would fly about fairness.

All of the letters would be put into a hat and drawn for the order of presentation. The presentation could take place on a Monday with one or two classes used for follow up discussions. This would be a situation where the teacher would facilitate the class. It would be critical that they allow the students to put forth their ideas based on what they heard and explain why they belief the position they are defending. Over the course of 5 weeks the major positions would be represented and at the very least the students would be exposed to some new ideas and some contrarian opinions.

Teachers have to spend even LOOOOOOOOOOOOONGEEEER to teach children evolution and abiogenesis and try filling in the major gaps which are left. What student can easily comprehend that the first amoeba turned, through a preposterous chain of events, into a human? The only students I know who comprehend that are ones who do so merely for the passing mark. Rest of the time they scoff at it and don't think about how the human race came into being. You are correct that teaching the creation theory of each religion would take a long time, but the Christian Creation Theory has its own text as the explanatory guidelines as well as more science to back it up than any proof evolution can muster. In fact, scientists are so confused as to exactly how 'evolution', abiogenesis etcetera works (because it doesn't and has gaps), that the theories are perpetually changing. For example, suppose that we did get a dog or cat out of the 'former species'. How exactly did each dog or cat develop into its own species instead of moving on to that of another creature? Why don't we just have one species of each? Evolution has such an incredible explanation that when opne really tries to comprehend, one gets lost. the Scientific mumbo jumbo sounds flawless, but it really isn't. The complexity of living systems could never evolve by chance—they had to be designed and created. A system that is irreducibly complex has precise components working together to perform the basic function of the system. (A mousetrap is a simple example.) If any part of that system were missing, the system would cease to function. Gradual additions could not account for the origin of such a system. It would have to come together fully formed and integrated. Many living systems exhibit this (vision, blood-clotting, etc.). When you look at a watch, you assume there was a watchmaker. A watch is too complex to "happen" by chance. Yet such living systems are almost infinitely more complex than a watch. They could not be random—they simply had to be designed and created. "The high information content of DNA could only have come from intelligence. Information science teaches that in all known cases, complex information requires an intelligent message sender. This is at the core of the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). DNA is by far the most compact information storage/retrieval system known. A pinhead of DNA has a billion times more information capacity than a 4-gigabit hard drive. Ironically, evolutionists scan the heavens using massive radio telescopes hoping for relatively simple signal patterns that might have originated in outer space, all the while ignoring the incredibly complex evidence of superior intelligence built into every human's DNA. While we're waiting to hear signs of intelligence behind interstellar communication, we're ignoring those built into us. No mutation that increases genetic information has ever been discovered. Mutations which increase genetic information would be the raw material necessary for evolution. To get from "amoeba" to "man" would require a massive net increase in information. There are many examples of supposed evolution given by proponents. Variation within a species (finch beak, for example), bacteria which acquire antibiotic resistance, people born with an extra chromosome, etc. However, none of the examples demonstrate the development of new information. Instead, they demonstrate either preprogrammed variation, multiple copies of existing information, or even loss of information (natural selection and adaptation involve loss of information). The total lack of any such evidence refutes evolutionary theory." http://creationismunleashed.blogspot.com/2005/08/ten-major-flaws-of-evolution.html So, why teach one falsehood over a supposed other? Why not teach them both and give the student the opportunity to choose right there in school - since s/he eventually will, anyway.

Obviously you know as much about it as I do about evolution. lol In a sense, you've told me to stop doing what dozens of others on this site do do - on both sides of the coin. As an example, Ryvius once listed an evolution propagandic link as his ONLY argument at the time. Interesting, huh? , ) This isn't a creation vs evolution debate, but as I said, Christianity starts out with a major advantage - a Textbook explicitly explaining how humanity came into being. As for Collisn, he seems to be a confused chap. He believes in God and that God created the Universe... and the world, but that He didn't create Man? How can you so blatantly ignore such a major part of the Bible (unless you are picking and choosing what you want to believe) and yet still claim to believe in God, His Son, doctrines etcetera. All the man is doing is picking and choosing his beliefs. As he re-examines himself, again, maybe his beliefs will again change. How about Blaise Pascal, C.S. Lewis, Isaac Newton, Dr. William Arion, Dr. John Baumgardner, Dr. Choong-Kuk Chang and a lot more who have accepted Creationism over evolution. In fact, there are a couple agnostics who accep creation or (at least) intelligent design rather than evolution. I think that we could go on all day listing names, though. LOL Yes, but supposing that the cat evolved from the dog again, okay? You're saying that they cross breeded naturally and we got a completely different species. Yet that other species of cat and the other species of dog is left unaccounted for. So we have wolf, fox, hyena, jackal, all part of the Canidae family and not sharing any DNA with any type of cat (or other animal). The Liger and mule are of the same type of family. Again, how'd a hyena come from a combination wolf/fox, and then how'd the wolf or fox come from the bear (as an example)? How'd they reproduce and multiply from the one specific type of creature (how'd a lion have another purebred if it was the result of crossbreeding)? It's all jumbled up, mate. The human body has its flaws and capabilities. Yet, it’s far better than that of any man made creation. I’ve never seen the same robot jump over five feet (or pole vault), play basketball, do three dozen math problems in ten minutes, build a birdhouse and then change the shingles. Have you? In short, no robot has the intricate respiratory system, cardiovascular system, brain etcetera that a human sports. Many diseases, weaknesses and flaws are actually the result of human actions. For example, Bubonic Plague was a tremendous disease… spread by fleas and rats and thus the result of poor sanitation. AIDS is spread in a variety of manmade ways. Rickets, alzheimers and ostioperosis are the result of not enough vitamins. You get the picture. In all reality, the intricate way God has designed the body is really and truly amazing.";7;0;3;Agree

If science teachers actually wanted to just present the facts as we know them, they would do only that. However, by offering along no other creation theories or options and by sticking to oldened beliefs, it practically forces what is taught into a child's brain. Correct, a child may not believe upon his/her own accord, but the possibilities rate that the only way a child will not believe is if another has provided alternate theories that seem more sensible, mostly of which are not provided.

OBVIOUSLY you either did not read my post all the way through, or you did a really bad job with the interpretation. No where did I say cram any religion down their throat. In fact, I said give them the info, along with explanation and allow them to decide. In todays world, some adults treat our kids as if they were clueless or do not have a brain. Reality is kids are still able and are quite capable of becoming brainiacs. The reason they are not, is because 1. we treat them as illiterates. 2.We do not allow them to make choices, with guidance. 3. They have become lazy. Why think, either it is not important, or it is done for them. 4.We give them no credit, do not have confidence in them 5.Allow them to be turned off and lazy. As for your first paragraph. I believe when I attended school we were taught gravity, but we also were taught that other cultures, (I distinctly remember) reading that people believed the earth to be flat. This was taught appropriately for the age I was at the time. I did not erroneousley pick the flat earth theory, because the teachers gave us all the evidence for both and then guided us to use common sense. "Do you really expect a child educated in the way you suggest to think that knowledge is possible?" I think it is possible for a child to be educated the way I suggested/ NOW if only the Unions and the Schools would come together and allow teachers to actually teach once again, instead of being paid babysitters, for the children we as parents and society have turned into spoiled brats....Enough said, I think you get the message! Yes, I believe if they are taught starting when they are young up until graduation, in a way that is appropriate for their age, they can learn anything. "Even adults are not always capable of making an informed decision, given the evidence. This is apparent from these forums. Do you really expect children to come to the right conclusions? Or are you cynically hoping that they'll pick the "easy" explanation (yours), and never give it another thought?" I did not say the easy explanation is mine. I stated that they be taught both. For the record, I am a Christian, but it did not play a part in my statement, My belief is no matter what the subject, if they are taught appropriately content for their age, they will come to the correct conclusion. I would not force anything down any one's throat and I believe I stated that!

It does not matter what the information is, or what it is about, what matters is if the information is presented appropriately to the student, and an explanation is given, the kids are quite capable of rendering good judgment and chosing the correct solution. This is how all teachers should be allowed to teach. Unfortunately we as parents are more interested in the sports and social life of our kids, rather than supplying them with knowledge to survive in this world. They need to be allowed to learn about critical thinking and using common sense to chose the right things in life based on the evidence and explanations they have been given.

2808;evolution;"I know that. It is just a matter of speech. this argument is not about the earth's spheroid qualities. here's some of those fallacies you asked for, "5 - Argumentum ad Populum. This is an argument addressed "to the people." This occurs when popular feelings are pandered to, when people are told what they want to hear—and what they are told is declared to be a "scientific fact." (1) "Science is progressive and is itself evolutionary" (2) "Evolution is the belief of moderns. " (3) "Everyone that is educated believes this theory." An implication of much of the evolutionary teaching is that our race has raised itself by its own bootstraps and we will eventually be gods, knowing and doing every possible thing, including inter-galactic space travel. All this appeals to the public, and they are assured that evolution must be true. At least, they surely hope so. 6 - Fallacy of Dating. Perhaps we could entitle this one the argumentum ad chronicum. The argument from age (dating fallacy) occurs when something is declared to be so simply by giving it an old date! All through the pages of this set of books we have repeatedly observed examples of the fallacy of proving evolution simply by dating various substances as very ancient. (1) Radioactive and other dating techniques are used to provide notoriously inaccurate dates, which are then declared to be correct. (Chapter 7.) These dates are then offered as evidence that evolutionary theory must be true. Yet, not only are the dates inaccurate, but the ancientness of such dates can never provide evidence of biological evolution, only trans-species fossil evidence from the past, and natural selection and mutational evidence today, can provide that—and both have signally failed to do so. (Chapters 13, 14, and 17.) (2) Without any reason for doing so, fossils and sedimentary strata have been arbitrarily assigned special ancient dates in the hope that this will heighten the impression that there is something "scientific" about evolutionary claims. Yet those fallacious dates provide us with no evidence of biological evolution. (Chapter 17.) (3) Very ancient dates have been arbitrarily assigned to paleomagnetic findings, on the basis of the erroneous dates claimed for fossils and strata. But, here again, the resultant dates are not evidence for biological evolution (Chapter 26.) 7 - Misuse of Analogy. One occurrence is referred to, and then, by analogy, is made an explanation for a different event, in order to provide evidence for a belief. *Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), an English philosopher, frequently spoke of the struggle between animals, and then said that, therefore, human beings must continually fight together also. That is a fallacy of analogical proof. (Chapter 33.) 8 - Fallacy of Special Pleading. This fallacy occurs when an individual positively or negatively dramatizes evidence in order to make it look very good or very bad. One example of this was *Haekel's dramatic lectures, complete with skeletons on the platform and large copies of his fraudulently prepared embryo charts. Another would be the dramatically presented "5-bone limb" charts in public presentations, to indicate evolutionary relationships. Yet, although many diverse creatures have the same number of bones in their arms, forearms, and hands, structural similarity does not demand genetic relationship. In contrast, the DNA barrier forbids one animal from descending from another. (Chapter 21.) We should stay with science, not artful words. 9 - Reasoning in a Circle. Circulus in probando, literally, "a circle in a proof," is the fallacy of circular reasoning. The cause is stated as being the proof of the effect, which normally would be all right,—but in this case, the cause IS the effect! Or A is used to prove B, then B is used to prove A! Circular reasoning is used several times as a proof of evolutionary theory. (1) "Because nothing was there, therefore that which exploded was nothing. Because stars were there afterward, they came from that explosion of nothing." (Chapter 1.) (2) "It took long ages to produce evolution, and we know it occurred because there were long ages while it occurred." (Chapters 7, 9.) (3) "There was only sand, seawater, lightning, and volcanoes to produce evolution, so we know that is what produced it. "Chapter 9.) (4) "Only a simple organism could have arisen when life first began, there are simple organisms alive today, so this shows that life began with a simple organism." (Chapters 9, 11.) (5) "Only the fittest have survived, so the things which have survived are the fittest." (Chapter 13.) 10 - Fallacy of Asserting the Consequences. Because an effect occurred, a certain cause must have taken place. The problem with this thinking is that several different causes could have produced that particular effect: "If It rains, I will get wet. I have gotten wet. Therefore it has rained." (1) "We know the stars must have evolved out of nothing because they are here now, and they had to come from somewhere." (Chapter 2.) (2) "The earth must be millions of years old, because evolution requires millions of years." (Chapter 17.) (3) "The earth must be millions of years old, because scientists, using a score of assumptions, have radiodated it that age." (Chapter 7.) (4) "Life had to evolve out of non-living materials, for there is no other way plants and animals could have gotten here." (Chapter 9.) (5) "Mutations were the cause of biological evolution because there is no other means by which it could have been accomplished." (Chapter 14.) (6) "Everything evolves—stars, earth, plants, animals, and Society—because that is the way it has to be." (Chapter 33.) 11-Argumentum ad Ignorantiam. This is the default fallacy. It is also called the "argument addressed to ignorance." Since one position cannot be proven, it must be the other, since no other position has been proven, ours must be the right one. (1) "Since creationism could not possibly be true, ours wins by default." (Chapters 37, 29.) (2) "Since no events in the far distant past can be scientifically falsified, then evolution must clearly be the cause of everything." (Chapter 37.) (3) "Evolution is the only theory which scientists believe to be correct, therefore it must be the right one." (Chapter 30.) (4) "A supernatural solution to the problem of origins is impossible—by definition!" (Chapters 29, 30.)" http://evolution-facts.org/Ev-V3/3evlch38.htm";7;0;3;"against evolution lessons in schools"

For a fact to be considered 'scientific', by definition, it must be testable by experimentation and show a consistent result when tested. Evolution IS testable by experimentation, if you define genetic modeling and studies of the fossil record to be a form of experiment, but it does not fit the other part of the bill: consistent results. Some ancient creatures, such as crocodilians and the coelocanth, have survived and coexist with their 'descendants', while others, such as human 'ancestors', were phased out like outdated software after the release of the next version. Some lifeforms took 'billions of years' to randomly mutate from the primordial soup, (On a timetable that, by the way, would have taken longer by random chance than the Earth's existense.) while others appeared fully developed in a relative instant. (See the so-called 'Cambrian Explosion') Some creatures successfully evolve on the basis of 'survival of the fittest', while others (such as the bat) randomly developed multiple traits that, while useless and even detrimental on their own, are highly useful together. (Poor eyesight, echolocation, wings... all added to a ground-dwelling critter that was faring just fine.) Shall I go on? My position is this: teach evolution, by all means, but teach it as it is: as a yet-unproven THEORY! To do otherwise is to force an opinion (note the word, opinion) on the students that is not an established fact yet. Prove the theory right, and I'll support it wholeheartedly!

It is possible that even Einsteins theory of gravitration could need further refining. So while there is plenty of evidence supporting these theories, they are not known to be facts. In fact, the only scientific field that I can think of that deals with indesputible facts is mathematics. The rest is all just theory. When you say Gravity is a fact, you're only talking about an abstract idea that were pulled towards the earth. We can at least witness gravity, and so we can make a logical deduction that it is true everywhere else in the universe, even in spite of this, it is still a theory. Nobody has witnessed evolution.

No proof for a young earth. No, no proof. But there is evidence. 1. There is little or no evidence of erosion between the layers in rock, supposedly laid down millions of years apart. With the amount of erosion we see today, that (at least should) strike you as a little strange. 2. Every year, about 450 million tons of sodium is deposited into the ocean. Less than 28% of that makes it back out. The rest simply accumulates. Of course, my questions about radioactive decay apply here too. But even if there was none to begin with, and the input rates were as much lower as they could rationally be, and output rates as much higher, the maximum time it would take for the amount of sodium now to accumulate would be 62 million years - far longer than the 6000 we estimate, but that's not really a problem, as the beginning amount could have been far higher than nothing.

All of my evidence about God comes from the Bible, where He has revealed Himself. I believe God is a Spirit because He says so in the Bible.

That's also my answer to the baseball. I believe God exists because there is a Book written about and by Him that DOES have evidence and logic to support it. As for the evidence and logic - one, see the debate about the origin of morality. Although you still probably won't agree with the logic there presented. two In Daniel, sometime before 585 BC, there is a prophecy, VERY specific, about the conquest of Babylon by the Medes and Persians, followed by Alexander the Great's invasion, the splitting of the kingdom into four, and the cruel oppression of the Jews by Antiochus Epiphanus. There is also in Daniel a more obscure (though still clear in hindsight) vision of the Persians, Greeks, Romans, and then the splitting of the Roman Empire into East and West. In the New Testament Jesus predicts the downfall of Jerusalem by the Romans. And there are many other examples. There is archeological evidence: the Dead Sea Scrolls, references to Jesus in secular writings, the 'nonexistent' Hittite empire, long a source of ridicule against the Bible, but later found, small tidbits doubted, but later confirmed by archeology, (can't remember the name of the person, but will look it up), and other things. There is geological evidence of the Flood (no matter how much you may deny it) such as sheet erosion, rivers running THROUGH mountains (how DOES evolution explain that one? It's sure that the rivers weren't running over the tops of mountains for millions of years until finally they carved a ravine!), and more. This is just off the top of my head so there aren't heaps of examples just now. There is anthropological (is that how you spell it?) evidence - you find a GLOBAL flood story, with many characteristics in virtually all cultures in the world. Generally if every culture has a version of the same story, then it means there must be at least some truth in the story.

Here is a snippet from the first link because I doubt you are going to go to any of those, it appears you think you have done "your homework". "Big Bang Theory - Common Misconceptions There are many misconceptions surrounding the Big Bang theory. For example, we tend to imagine a giant explosion. Experts however say that there was no explosion, there was (and continues to be) an expansion. Rather than imagining a balloon popping and releasing its contents, imagine a balloon expanding: an infinitesimally small balloon expanding to the size of our current universe". "You can't have an effect without a cause". I'm sorry if I did not explain myself clearly enough, I thought I did a rather good job but apparently not as you seem to have missed the point. I was in no way saying that there was a cause without an effect, I do not know how you came to that conclusion. Let me try again. Let's say there's this animal that looks almost like a chicken (for the point of this question it doesn't matter where this animal came from) and it lays an egg. Inside the egg, the embryo mutates. When the thing hatches out of the egg it is different to it's mother, it mutated in to a chicken. Therefore the egg came first, because while a chicken didn't lay the egg, there was essentially a chicken inside it. (evolution would not be exact, like that, as it is so slow that every generation seems the same as the last- but hopefully this time you see the point). I'm not saying this is exactly what happened, just that it's worth a thought. The restatement was because I don't think you thought about it.

A chimp has the same respiratory, circulatory, reproductive, etc, etc systems as us, at least in most areas. Their build is much the same as ours. Why would a Creator make different DNA for something that has the same function? But they also have major differences, such as their hands and feet, their faces, and especially their brain and the way it functions as compared to us. So in that way they are different. That's where the 2% of different DNA comes from. Similar DNA simply means that that DNA is coding for the same thing. It says nothing about the reason for it. It could just as easily be a common Creator as a common ancestor. I realize, of course that the supposed common ancestor between a human and a chimpanzee did not necessarily look like either. I'm not really sure where you're going with that, though. Nor with your comment as to that a creator would make us all the same genetic distance.

1190;evolution;"In your Douglas Adams argument, well, I don't see anywhere in the Bible that God requires faith to exist. God exists whether we believe in Him or not. Plus, it contradicts itself - it says that one thing proves that God exists, and this proof in turn proves that He doesn't...ummm, then what about the proof that He does exist? You can't have both. Furthermore, what were you exactly meaning with the Babel fish? Not sure if you're talking about Jonah, or what.... I'm not trying to ridicule you here, I just would like to be clear on what you meant. Next, I can't recall myself saying that I believe the Bible because God wrote it, and I believe in God because the Bible says He exists. That is indeed circular reasoning, and if I have given you that impression I apologize. I believe in God partly because of the Bible, and partly because of the experience of people. I believe in the Bible because I can see that all the verifiable things written in the Bible have been verified. History in the Bible has been vindicated time and again. There are scientific references in the Bible found out only far later by people (a good indication that it was indeed written by God). Because of these supports, the Bible becomes far more credible in the things that cannot be verified. I believe that God wrote the Bible because the Bible says so. I believe that God created the world in six days because the Bible says so. I believe that there was a year long (actually, the water was only there for 150 days) global Flood because the Bible says so. Scientific facts only corroborate my view. As for the Flood - Noah was told to take 2 of every unclean kind and 7 of every clean kind. It's not very clear whether this is 2 and 7 pairs or individuals, but it doesn't really matter. Keep in mind that doesn't mean 2 of every modern species - it's far, far less. Such as two dogs out of all the kinds of dogs, two cats out of all the cats, etc, etc. The big animals were no doubt not so big then, being young, which would be an advantage both during the Flood, and afterwards, with reproduction. Where did the water come from/go? 'The windows of heaven were opened, and the fountain of the great deep' - it's obvious God intervened miraculously here, whether to take water from above the 'firmament' (as it says in the Creation story, that He separated the waters), or from inside the earth, or whether He simply created it. Three quarters of the earth is water today, and there is plenty of water to cover the mountains if the ocean basins were raised and the mountains flattened. There was undoubtedly massive seismic movement during the Flood, causing, for one, the continent to split apart (there's the answer of where the animals came from. After all, you also believe that all the land was in one place to start with), as well as the raising of the mountains, and the lowering of the ocean bases. The ark was indeed one of the largest wooden ships ever built, but that doesn't mean it couldn't work. After all, we still have no idea how the ancient Egyptians built the Pyramids, but that doesn't mean they didn't do it, because they obviously did. The fossil record is something else. We don't know exactly, of course, how it happened, but wouldn't you expect the more intelligent animals to realize something was wrong and try to flee to high ground, thus being killed and buried later? And the humans would have survived longer even than that, by clinging to rafts or trees, and so mostly decomposed without ever being buried. The layers were all made basically at the same time. Besides, how do you explain marine fossils on mountain tops?";7;0;3;Creation
1190;evolution;"Actually, in my Bible, 2 Samuel 8:4 says that he captured 1000 chariots, and 7000 horsemen, and 1 Chron 18:4 says exactly the same thing. I'm not sure which Bible you're using, but I use the KJV. Maybe you just read it wrong? The lists in Nehemiah and Ezra are indeed hard to answer, but there are reasonable solutions. One is that there is a scribal error - which explanation I find weak, especially as it then indicates that the Bible in English is actually not inerrant. The other solution goes like this. Ezra states that THESE ARE the .... He has the right numbers. Nehemiah states that he FOUND a register of the census and used that. This census was not inspired by God, and thus could very well be inaccurate. The Bible often records things in the Bible that are part of the story, but not necessarily correct, such as the letter Sanballat wrote to Nehemiah, and others. You didn't mention this, either, but it's related, that the total number in both Nehemiah and Ezra as stated are the same, but in counting up the numbers, they don't match. However, the numbers of the clans were only the numbers of the men, as is also stated. The total number of the CONGREGATION can be interpreted as including the wives and/or children of the men, unlikely, as it would give a very skewed percentage of unmarried men, or as including the the male children who would grow up to become leaders. This seems likely. We of course do not actually know why there is a discrepancy. My point here is not to force my opinion on you, but to show you that there are reasonable explanations, so it need not necessarily be a contradiction. The 'contradiction' about the earth lasting forever - once again, look at the context. In Ecclesiastes, Solomon is not really speaking literally. He speaks of the sun hastening down, of the wind turning about and going in it's circuit. We too speak of the sun going down, but we don't really mean it. It's just a way of expressing ourselves. The point of Ecclesiastes is that 'everything is vanity', basically. At least it's certainly a recurring theme. Solomon is here saying that in the face of the length of time the earth has existed, what is man? What is one generation? I do not believe that his intent was to state that the earth would be literally lasting forever. There are answers for the others, but it's late and I'm tired, so I will leave it for now. What Jesus is saying in John 3 is not that there have never been people who have gone to heaven without dying, but rather, it is in the context of his disciples believing what He says about heaven. Jesus is saying that there is no one on the earth who has gone up to heaven and come down again to tell people about what heaven is like, besides Himself.";7;0;3;Creation

A few months later, it turned out that the "fossil" was simply bones from two dinosaurs glued together. Look it up. Evolution is a theory, just like creationism.

Teachers have a hard enough time getting from the Colonial Period to the Civil Rights movement, from atoms to zoology, in a period when teachers are getting laid off, not hired, I find the notion comical of adding another topic to the course load. There are many things which would be great electives in High School. Classes on how the stock market functions, 21st c. U.S. history, Sociology, advanced physics, or how about an elective where the kids do independent studies based on their projected college major? All awesome right? Fine, pay for it with your tax dollars then. Evolutionism can be taught at local churches and in college.

And why excactly should the secular beliefs be taught in public schools, when evolution is just as much a religion as christianity. Evolution is NOT based on fact, it is based on THEORIES - and unproven ones at that. Both beliefs don't have enough factual evidence to support them, so why should the taxpayers have to pay for one but not the other. It's not that hard to add a chapter on creationism in a science textbook as it is a theory, and as such has the right to be taught and discussed What exactly gave you the impression that we should have to pay for schools to teach such a ridiculous and unproven theory? And, once again, could you please list some of those "democracies" in which Christianity is illegal? Your arguments lack facts. Stick to evidence, not emotions.";7;0;3;No

This creator is God *AS IT IS THE ONLY BEING WHO CAN LOGICALLY BE OUTSIDE OF TIME*. *If you take this line of thought it is quite obvious that you are just assuming that everything that exists must have been created, you take it as a given.* - It is a given. Give me an example of something that has not creator. HA got you. *ask yourself the question, "does everything that exist require a creator?” If you answer yes then you accept the premise that there are an infinite amount of things before God because if God exists then he he must have been created and therefore have a creator, and so on forever.* - Except that God Is timeless and eternal therefore he needs no beginning and no creation. This is obvious because he cannot die and because the bible says so. The Universe is full of death so nothing in it could have created the universe and since there is death it is not eternal. *If you answer no not everything that exists needs a creator then you must accept the implication that: 1. God does not need a creator. 2. The universe does not need a creator.* - Only if you assume God is limited within time. And the bible clearly shows he is not. Once again your atheistic remarks fail. *All this philosophy tells us is that there may be no creator, one creator or many creators and that a single creator is not necessary to explain the universe.* - This is your atheistic philosophy *If you are tempted to say "yes the universe exists and needs a creator, but no God - the first cause- exists and does not need a creator" Please be aware that this is just an assertion that is not based on fact or reason and as such does nothing whatsoever to prove the existence of God, only the illogic one must invoke to protect their illusions.* - Pfft, Go read the Bible. all the facts are clearly listed.

4732;evolution;"I disagree with most of what you have to say. It may be a fallacy to derive a prescriptive statement from a descriptive statement. The only way that a person could do this is with hidden presuppositions that should be stated to clarify the argument. This however is not by concern. There are logical reasons to have an uncaused first cause. It is logically necessary. People have come to this conclusion without any religious motivations, people such as Plato and Aristotle. Even this is not my concern, to even debate this would be to follow your Red Herring. The only thing that I am concerned about is your last statement. You said " you can not logically provide an argument for intelligent design without referring to the bible." This is completely false, you should study a bit more. There are several trained scientists who have provided good empirical evidence to support the intelligent design hypothesis. You should look into their work, then rephrase your statement. You should read Michael Behe's work. He wrote a good book called 'Darwin's Black Box'. Also look into William Dembski's work and the work of Stephen C. Meyer. These are just a few educated people who have built arguments in support of intelligent design with out using the Bible. P. S. let us know how your studies go.";7;0;3;"Intelligent design is logical"
3221;evolution;"THis is no debate since you have only claimed OPINION.";7;0;3;"Intelligent design is logical"
4732;evolution;"I want to apologize for my attitude, I am in the wrong for that. Thank you for your correction. 1) “The man who never reads will never be read, he who never quotes will never be quoted. He who will not use the thoughts of other men's brains, proves that he has no brains of his own.”-- Charles Spurgeon. The reason why I only referred you to the knowledge of other people, is because their thoughts and research go way deeper than my layman knowledge. Micheal Behe is a biologist, the only thing that he is going to do is formulate a hypothesis and provide empirical data. This is why I also referred you to William Dembski, and Steven C. Meyer. They are philosophers who provide additional evidence for Behe's hypothesis. My basic point was to show that your statement is false. "you can not logically provide an argument for intelligent design without referring to the bible". If any person was to read these peoples work, they would be able to recognize that. 2) When it comes to the whole who created God subject. You are absolutely correct, people who provide you with explanations like that are not providing you with much of anything. However, I will say that the question of who created God has no bearing on the debate subject, the universe could have been designed by a god who was designed himself. This is not the case, I will give you some logical arguments that demonstrate why God is and must be uncreated. There are several arguments that I could select, philosophers have been thinking about these arguments for centuries. Here is one that was produced by Aristotle in the late 300 B.C., but modified by Thomas Aquinas in the mid 1200 A.D. Here the argument is in syllogistic form. The argument from motion: 1. Things do move. Motion is the most obvious form of change. 2. Change is a passing from potency to act (i.e. from potentiality to actuality) 3. Nothing passes from potency to act except by something that is in actuality, for it is impossible for a potentiality to actualize itself. 4. There cannot be an infinite regress of actualizers or movers. If there is no First Mover, there can be no subsequent motion, since all subsequent motion depends on prior movers for its motion. 5. Therefore, there must be a first, Unmoved Mover, a pure actualizer with no potentiality in it that is unactualized. 6. This is understood to be God. Here is one more syllogistic argument from Thomas Aquinas. The argument from possibility and necessity. 1. There are beings that begin to exist and cease to exist (i.e. possible beings) 2. But not all beings can be possible beings, because what comes to exist does so only through what already exists. Nothing cannot cause something. 3. Therefore, there must be a Being whose existence is necessary (i.e. one that never came into being and will never cease to be) 4. There cannot be an infinite regress of Necessary Beings, each of which has its necessity dependent on another because a.) An infinite regress of dependent causes is impossible. For unless there is a first cause of the series there would be no causality in the series. b.) A Necessary Being cannot be a dependent being. 5. Therefore, there must be a first Being that is necessary in itself and not dependent on another for its existence. I hope that these are more logical than the normal responses that you have been getting on this subject. p.s. I want to say again that I am sorry for my attitude, in my first post. And thank you for correcting me.";7;0;3;"Intelligent design is logical"
4493;evolution;"I have not read the above posts but i am arguing from the point that intelligent design is a fallacious argument. Firstly lets look at what intelligent design is meant to be. It's meant to be a science. However i don't really see what is scientific about pointing at things that the evolutionairy theory cannot yet explain, and purporting the existence of a designer by default. That is simply ludicrous and reductive. Also those who advocate intelligent design seem to point at the most obscure things. They don't however point at humans or at snakes or birds, whose existence is expalined very well by the evolutionairy debate. (Those wishing to mention the complexity of the eye should research evolutionairy explanations for it, and see that the theory accounts for the evolution of the eye perfectly well). Intelligent design falls apart when trying to explain even the most basic things. Why is it when you cut open a whale or an anaconda, you find the last remnants of a leg bone. A useless pointless bone. A similar argument could be used as to why humans have an appendix. A useless pointless time bomb of a gland. Intelligent design falls apart when it tries to explaiin these occurences. Let's see what the most logical answer would be. Was it A God was drunk. Or B the whale is a mammal who used to live on land who adapted to live in the sea, and humans used to be herbivores in the evolutionairy past, meaning they needed an appendicts to help digest the food. Also please don't refer me to read the works of those who advocate intelligent design. There biased and subjective. They quite clearly believe in there religion very strongly, making there work very subjective, when science is supposed to be objective. Intelligent design is a religious adaptation to the American constitution. As religion is banned from being taught in American schools, and religion relies on spreading itself through indoctrinating the credulous children of the world, intelligent design is the logical conclusion to a doctrine trying to adapt itself to the modern world. Intelligent design fails to explain even the most simplistic of observations like why humans share 99% of their DNA with chimps. Evolution expalins these things perfectly";7;0;3;"Intelligent design is logical"
4732;evolution;"There is only two possibilities, ether it was a conscious mind or an unconscious thing. Based on observation of the world around us things move as a result of a conscious mind. If a conscious mind does not act upon an object that object stays static. When we consider nature, wind moves things, planets rotate, etc. The cause of this movement is unknown. Based on observation of the world around us it is not unreasonable to conclude that some conscious mind (being) is responsible for the motion of the universe. The only other option is that some unconscious thing is responsible for the motion of the universe. This, however, runs contrary to everything that we observe in the world around us. As far as the Necessary Being is concerned. In the context of the argument a possible being does not have to be a conscious entity. It is anything that comes into existence. However, the Necessary Being must be conscious, because some of the beings that emanate from it are conscious. This is not unreasonable, we have never observed an unconscious being produce a conscious being. Those are the only two options either the Necessary Being is conscious or it is not. It is more reasonable based on common knowledge that this being must be conscious.";7;0;3;"Intelligent design is logical"
4732;evolution;"I was not trying to say that the cause of the wind was unknown. What I meant was the cause of the motion of the universe is unknown. We know that all motion started at the Big Bang when all space, time, and matter were produced. This includes gravity, atoms, and everything else that produces motion in our universe.This is the first motion. This is the motion that the argument from motion focuses on. What produced the first motion? Based on observation it is reasonable to say it was by a conscious mind (being). "However, the Necessary Being must be conscious, because some of the beings that emanate from it are conscious. This is not unreasonable, we have never observed an unconscious being produce a conscious being." Nor have we observed a conscious being create a universe, (or anything out of nothing) yet this is reasonable to conclude?" So based on what we experience everyday in reality, is that conscious beings produce conscious beings. It is not unreadable to conclude that the Necessary Being must be a conscious mind. You base your conclusion off of your own preference, you do not have any observable facts to back up your conclusion. This is unreasonable and a large leap of faith. Not to mention that science says that the universe came into being at a finite time. Making the universe a possible being. 1. There are beings that begin to exist and cease to exist (i.e. possible beings) THE UNIVERSE 2. But not all beings can be possible beings, because what comes to exist does so only through what already exists. Nothing cannot cause something. THE UNIVERSE COULD NOT BE CAUSED BY NOTHING. 3. Therefore, the universe can not be the Necessary Being. Based on everything that we know about our universe and logic. I am completely justified and reasonable to conclude that a conscious mind caused the beginning of the universe.";7;0;3;"Intelligent design is logical"
