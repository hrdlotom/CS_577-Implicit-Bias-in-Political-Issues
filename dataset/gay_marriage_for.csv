867,"gay marriage","I'm pretty much the same way about gay marriage, but for different reasons and with different caveats.
First of all, "gay marriage" is a misleading term, since "marriage" is a religious institution that was co-opted by government for the purpose of taxes, benefits, legal situations, etc. (Whatever happened to separation of church and state, eh?) Government should stay out of the religious institution of marriage. In that context, the gov't has no right telling anyone who can marry who.
If the gov't wants to create a secular, social contract for the purposes of taxes, benefits, etc, and allow gay versions of that, then that's fine. On top of that, if gays can find a church that will marry them in a religious ceremony, then fine...but if they can't find a church to marry them, no lawsuits allowed. It's wrong (not to mention unconstitutional) to force a religion to go against its tenets and ideals just because someone outside the religion doesn't like them.
So, I'm against "gay marriage" but not against "gay social contracts" (secular "marriage").",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"

911,"gay marriage","Some suggest gay marriage will merely undermine one of our most fundamental societal institutions, causing countless straight couples to get divorced because exclusion of gays was the only thing holding their marriage together.
But we know better. Gay marriage killed the dinosaurs. If we let liberal activist judges in Massachusetts and California set the course, the blood will run in rivers. Mixed with molten lava.
Top ten reasons to make gay marriage illegal
01.) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.
02.) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.
03.) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.
04.) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.
05.) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britney Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.
06.) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs more children.
07.) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.
08.) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours, the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.
09.) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.
10.) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

I would absolutely love to read the passage where the Bible says gays can't get married; where it is against God's will. Unfortunately, I can't because I wouldn't know which version of the Bible to read for it has been reprinted, translated and quite possibly re-written over 200 times!

I am not religious. I will offer that up and you can attack me on this all you want. I am agnostic, for reference reasons. I am spiritual. I believe there is a reason science can't explain for the existence and the reason behind many, many things in this world. I believe that marriage is about love. Unfortunately, just like the definition of love, heterosexuals are already perverting the definition and, quite possibly, the sanctity of marriage that Pres. Bush is now on some warpath to protect. Divorce rates are rising faster and faster and marriages are decreasing in duration; the shortest being 55 hours!

What this argument fails to understand is that marriage (and its definition) is a constantly evolving institution.

So to say that "gay marriage goes against the concept of marriage", as is frequently argued, really means "we should not redefine marriage to allow gay marriage."
Now, that may be a conclusion of an argument, or an opinion, but it is not a valid premise or reason for arguing that the right to marry should be granted to homosexuals.

Most people agree that marriage is important for the well-being of children. In general, children of unmarried parents have less stable lives, both emotionally and financially. But anti-gay-marriage advocates are willing to sacrifice those children simply to avoid the perceived negative consequences of recognizing a legally and morally binding relationship between two people of the same sex.

If you think it will, I believe the onus is on you to demonstrate that difference.
Gay people already have relationships, and they already are raising children within those relationships. Allowing homosexuals access to marriage laws which strengthen and support those relationships (and therefore strengthen and support the stability of the child's home) only makes public policy sense.

Whether or not the State has an interest in procreation, there is no aspect of marital law that requires or inquires about fertility. Fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law. Your response was a total red herring.

Do you realize that women were considered chattel, and that neither participant in a marriage had any free will? Far from the “Cinderella” model we train our children with, marriage was just a financial and political transaction.
That is the vaunted history you are so valiantly defending. In fact, marriage *did* change, from that model to the one we take for granted now. And in between it was unthinkable for blacks to marry whites; marriage changed again. It seems you have conveniently forgotten the past and wish to slam the door now that marriage has been re-defined the way you like it.
Do you realize that a mere 50 years ago when people were arguing against miscegenation they used the *exact* *same* arguments that you are using now? Look it up. Exactly the same. It's not a coincidence. It's because they had no good reason to stop blacks and whites from marrying, and you have no good reason to stop two men or two women from marrying.

As far as The Incredibles, this at least is one argument that nobody used in the 1950's (at least not in that form). So your point is that marriage is so special that it has to be defended against any changes because such changes would render it ordinary (and what's the problem with that again?).

This thread already mentions the “55 hour” marriage of some spoiled brat. What about arranged marriages – are you protecting them too?

*You* are making the positive statement, that current marriage laws are somehow historically based on some probability of reproduction. As the one who makes the claim, it should be your responsibility to demonstrate it. Yet you don't - you just keep making the claim.
Presumably you admit that there is no legal reference to procreation or reproduction in current U.S. marriage laws, but you claim that deep within the concept of marriage laws is buried statistical analyses that rely on reproduction. That is a heavy claim, one that is far from obvious and is in dire need of some form of substantiation.
My understanding of the history of marriage does not bear out your claim. What is your basis for concluding that ancient governments (who formalized common law marriage which was then codified into U.S. law) used reproduction statistics for this purpose? To demonstrate your point some historical evidence of the statistical basis of common law marriage would be helpful.
Even if I postulate that your claim is correct, you haven't addressed the sociological fact that homosexual couples are now becoming parents at faster and faster rates. Given your statistical argument in defense of marriage, you should have some formula that should show the break-even point at which homosexual reproductive proclivities will allow them equal access to existing marriage laws. More simply, if across all marriages heterosexuals reproduce at rate R, do homosexuals need to match R exactly to get equal rights? Can they be .9R, or .5R?
If instead of the overall rate R, consider the rate of stable, 2 parent, non-divorced heterosexual procreators, R-stable. Shouldn't homosexuals only need to match this metric to gain equal access to marriage laws? Isn't R-stable a better indicator of the health of the children being raised, and therefore the overall benefit to society? In my experience the overall rate of committed non-divorced homosexual parents is much higher than heterosexual parents (simply because the universe is so much smaller and children do not arrive "by accident") - this would appear to be to society's overall benefit.

This is unproveable, unrealistic and frankly grandiose.

Society pays dearly for at least 2 decades for each helpless human brought into it, and the cost for unhealthy humans quickly skyrockets both in terms of money outlays and lost productivity).

The funny thing is how detailed this foray into controlling marriage has become. There’s no question about controlling people who marry 20 times in a row, or for 5 days or people 70 years younger than themselves, but the amount of thought you’re giving to controlling two consenting adults who wish to legalize their commitment to one another is astounding.

By the way, if someone is born with an indeterminate sexual identity (which happens much more than you probably think it does), or if they change their sexual identification, how will that affect the new civil-union-cum-marriage structure you are constructing? Will you be using genetic markers, genitalia, statistical tests of mental identification, or some other more advanced method to determine whether two people should be permitted to marry under the “M-M” or “W-W” rules? Of course there are no such problems for M-W relationships… or are there?

”They aren't. How can any child's interests be advanced by not giving him $100? This is just the same cost/benefit question. “
Huh? If two people decide to marry and procreate, the question is whether they should be allowed to legally marry if they happen to have the same genitalia. Nobody’s talking about giving children money. We’re talking about letting their parents marry, just as heterosexual parents do. My question to you was how it helps children of homosexuals to deny their parents the right to legally commit to one another.

By “unjustifiable” do you mean I cannot have any basis for my explicit assertions? You’re wrong.

"I bet some of those trees are the tallest trees in the forest"
Let's examine this statement. It is a tautology – clearly *some* of the the trees in the forest are the tallest trees. Therefore it would be inane to argue for or against this statement. Additionally, due to the nature of the statement (“tallest”) you must by definition examine every tree in the forest (or come up with a good statistical approximation) to know which *are* the tallest trees in the forest. Examining individual trees is pointless, not because examination of individual trees gives you no information, but because your statement is a tautology.
Now if instead of your statement I say “Some of the trees in that forest are diseased”, *then* it would make sense to examine some of the trees in the forest. You might get a positive result (if you find a diseased tree), and you might not get enough information to validate the statement, but you *will* gain some information. Or you could generalize and say “all living things get diseases therefore common sense tells me the statement is true,” in which case I would ask you to defend *that* statement, since common sense also tells me that if a forest is small enough and homogeneous enough that it may well consist of all healthy trees. In any case, the statement alone is not sufficient justification to cut down all the trees.
Now let's look at your main argument (I paraphrase): “It costs society financially when it marries people and generally recoups that cost only when the couple reproduces.” Far from a tautology, this statement begs for some sort of evidence, even if only some random examples. I *have* begged you, but you have provided nothing but appeals to common sense and forests and trees.
“You can hang your hat on the idea that procreation has nothing to do with marriage law, and I will hang my hat on the idea that it has something to do with it.”
I have never hung my hat on your straw man assertion that “procreation has nothing to do with
marriage law”. My points are 1) you haven't demonstrated any evidence for your contention that the State sustains a net loss for each marriage that does not produce offspring, and 2) this is not a question of financial gain or loss, but of civil rights.
“It matters how the state does when people have or will have children get married.”
What is your basis for making this bald statement? Certainly there is no such law in this country addressing reproduction of married couples. Your reliance on “common sense” and “hidden formulas” is well and good, but don't you need *some* sort of evidence to make such a sweeping statement? Does modern economics (I last studied it in the '70s) automatically give credence to all hidden formulas, or do they have to have some factual basis? Hopefully economists don't rely on “common sense” to justify their positions, the way you seem to.
In any case I can demonstrate the falsity of your claim. You are applying the above rule to homosexuals. Let's say a good statistical analysis showed (and this is a hypothetical, not a statement of fact or a claim) that when white people marry it cost the State more than when Hispanic people marry. You'll agree, I hope, that such a statement is subject to analysis, is conceivable, and therefore is possibly true. If it were true, would you advocate different marriage laws for whites and Hispanics?
If your answer is “yes” ... I won't even bother finishing that sentence, because of course your answer is not “yes.” Therefore, why is it permissible to create a separate system of laws for a sub-group distinguished by their sexuality and not for a sub-group distinguished by their ethnicity?
“...Presumably because you have been indoctrinated with the idea that it is solely a civil rights issue...”
Because you say “solely” I assume you admit that this is at least partially a civil rights issue. My question to you is whether the State's financial losses (according to you) override those civil rights issues. If so, please give me another example of how the State can override civil rights based on a financial incentive.

A), it is not necessarily true (in fact, I think I presented some strong evidence that it is false; see below), and B), it is irrelevant to the issue of granting equal rights to all members of society.
I ask you where the following analysis fails: A married couple without children costs the State some negligible legal and processing fees, perhaps some income tax, and potentially the cost of caring for them when they are older (although I could easily posit that without spending their money on raising children a majority of childless couples are better able to pay for their own old age care). A married couple *with* children will cost the state the same administrative costs as the childless couple, plus a lot more administrative costs for each child, then educational expenses, health care expenses, tax deductions, police and judicial costs (for less-than-perfect children who break the law), foster parenting costs (for less-than-perfect parents), adoption costs, judicial costs for divorces (which become immensely more expensive when children are involved), etc. I could go on for hours. Now, show me something similar which explains how childless couples end up costing the State more than couples with children.

Homosexuals can reproduce just fine, although not with their partners. Nothing stops gay people from reproducing just as readily as heterosexuals - it just doesn't happen by accident.
Human beings are extremely complex creatures. It is too simplistic to reduce our emotions and sexuality to "why not just be friends?".
It is very admirable that you do not hate or isolate homosexuals. However your good will depends upon them remaining a minority, invisible, inferior, and being looked down upon.

1037,"gay marriage","Selective quoting of a prior argument:
You quoted me but failed to reproduce the beginning of my statement – here it is in its entirety (Feb 5 1:11): “[...] there is no aspect of marital law that requires or inquires about fertility. Fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law.” *That* is what I was saying; I was *not* refuting your statement (which you made *after* I said the above, not before) that marriage law was influenced by procreation. The way you quoted me and juxtaposed your subsequent argument made it look like I was contradicting myself, which is neither true nor fair.
My words do not speak to what influenced marriage law. Whether such laws are historically evolved from fertility considerations is neither significant nor in dispute, nor was I referring to that contention when I made my statement. Which you knew.
Then you say:
“First, let me point out an amusing illustration. I demanded facts rather than common sense to back up your assertion that facts and common sense are antithetical (not different, mind you, but antithetical). You supplied no facts, but rather made an appeal to common sense: "Please tell me you understand this concept without me having to explain it more than that."”
You quoted the third sentence of 8 sentences I wrote explaining why common sense is antithetical to facts. That was the only sentence of the 8 that did not directly address facts concerning the issue. That you chose to quote and respond to that sentence and ignore the other 7 tells me you are not arguing honestly. There is no point to my writing direct answers to your direct questions since you purposely ignore the intent and spirit of my answer and instead use semantic jumbling, selective quoting, and mischaracterization to make those answers look stupid.
Back to the argument at hand:
“Note that my appeal to common sense arose from and has always been limited to the dispute on whether procreation has influenced marriage law.”
I've already agreed to your point. Let's dispose of the “common sense” dispute.
Missing examples:
“On the contrary. I say that whether there is a civil rights issue depends on whether the State's financial losses are significant.”
I asked for an example of where the State overrides civil rights based on a financial incentive. Ignore for the moment whether gay marriage provides such a rationale – can you supply an example of *any* situation where the State has eroded civil rights for one group because of *financial* considerations? If not, then I propose there is no point arguing whether this particular situation justifies such an act, because such acts never occur.
For example, consider the group consisting of premature infants born weighing less than 2 pounds. These people are “significant[ly]” costly to society in terms of money and productivity, yet there are no laws denying them equal rights to health care (say, prohibiting doctors from operating on them). Here's a clear-cut example of a tiny minority of people who are costing the State enormous amounts of money and effort, and yet those costs do not outweigh their civil rights. Can you provide an example of the opposite, where a group's civil rights are outweighed by their cost to society?
“But most laws promote the social good at the expense of a group (almost no laws are perfectly Pareto optimal).”
Do you have any examples? “Most” means you think 50% of laws promote social good at the expense of a group. Like what, speed limit laws? Seat belt laws? Passport laws? Murder laws? Are you seriously expressing the opinion that 51% of laws enforce a “social good” to the detriment of a particular group of people? Don't you think huge statements like this one deserve some sort of attempt at a factual support? Or is this just “common sense” at work again?
Another huge, groundless claim you make, which becomes broader and broader each time you express it, is that laws are based on cost. Certainly laws are influenced by costs, but you are making the claim that the primary measure of a law's worth is its financial cost to society vs. its financial payout. I am not arguing this point any more because you haven't provided any examples of it and I don't think it is true. You are using it as a justification for being against gay marriage and therefore I should address it in that context, but I am weary of fighting that side battle when you have provided nothing but blanket assertions and appeals to “modern economics” and “common sense”.
And now you off to the races on discrimination. Using the same argument you fail to support with respect to gay marriages, you now suggest that we *would* (and presumably *should* based on cost analysis) have different laws for different races if we could demonstrate the cost to society is different. I'm not arguing this because it is spectacularly wrong and way off track for this conversation. I introduced the concept of discrimination with respect to marriage laws because it is so obvious (my appeal to common sense) that there should be none. At least you're consistent in advocating discrimination if the cost justifies it.
“You might suggest that sexual preference should receive the same
standard of scrutiny under equal protection as race.”
Yup.
“it is not quite as worrisome as it is in the case of race because (a) race is generally more quickly
identifiable (visually, often by the name, sometimes by speech patterns, etc.) where sexual preferences are not always quickly identifiable”
So gay people don't deserve to be treated equally under the law because they can't be picked out of a crowd?
“...homosexual people are finding more acceptance in various parts of society”
Or because they they have become more tolerated by society?
“Second, even racial distinctions are sometimes upheld under equal protection where race has a direct bearing on the matter and not merely a correlation.”
Like when? An example would be helpful.
“Gender has a direct bearing on procreation, and so might survive even the strictest equal protection scrutiny were it applied.”
It might. And it might not. An example would certainly be helpful.
“I told you earlier that it doesn't matter to my argument how the state does when married people have children. It matters how the state does when people who have or will have children get married. Did you understand the distinction?”
Sincerely, I have no idea what you're getting at. If there's some deep thought in this comment, it's completely lost on me.
You say that costs matter. I give you examples of costs. Instead of responding to those examples or giving your own and tying yourself to reality, you ignore my examples, make an arcane distinction which has nothing to do with them, and (needless to say) provide no examples of your own (I'm beginning to realize that you really don't like examples). Okay, so take my examples and change the phrase “married couple” to “couple-who-want-to-get-married”. Now the paragraph describes “people who have or will have children” and want to get married, and therefore they matter to government and the costs matter. All the rest of the stuff in the paragraph stands (all my examples of costs). Can you please answer the question? How does the State do better when couples-who-want-to-get-married have children than couples-who-want-to-get-married who don't have children?
By the way, isn't “people who have or will have children” pretty much 100% of young people? I mean, you can't take a 20 year old and say “this person will never have children.” If that person wants to marry, doesn't the state have to presume they will reproduce whether their relationship is straight or gay? If it's in the State's best interests to see everyone reproduce, the State should make sure everyone marries a partner and provide free fertility treatment to all couples (gay or straight) that want to get pregnant. This might well eliminate any reproductive distinction (“baby gap”) between straights and gays.",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"

Your mistaken notion that God "created" human beings is silly, for starters. But even if he did, it's absolutely asinine to assume two sexes mean they are supposed to get married. Marriage is nothing but a piece of paper, ultimately.

You want to differentiate humans from animals, but the sad fact remains that we ARE animals, even if we have higher reasoning abilities. As for the notion of gay animals, you are sadly mistaken, once again. Google "OHSU GAY RAM STUDY" and you'll begin to learn a few things.

674,"gay marriage","Many of your sources are good, sabrejimmy. And many of your facts are straightforward, however a few flaws...
One, one of your sources is based on homosexual relationships in the Netherlands, AIDS cases are already known to be more frequent in African-Americans, one of your sources appears to be religiously inclined and can be seen as biased, the public agenda page concedes heterosexuals spread AIDS too, single heterosexual parents have been raising perfectly healthy children already and the domestic violence claims are 16 years old and could have changed significantly in both homosexual and heterosexual households since. Now, a fellow user wanted statistics from the CDC or some organization who is, in their eyes, reputable.
http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/basic.htm#exposure
According to the above page (whose data is only two years old), AIDS cases brought about by homosexual sexual contact alone rose approximately 2298%. AIDS cases brought about by heterosexual contact increased approximately 1122%. Also, AIDS cases brought about by injection drug use rose approximately 2593%. All in 2005. This shows us a few things:
-One, unprotected homosexual sexual contact contributing to the spread of AIDS is a truth.
-Two, heterosexual sexual contact ALSO leads to AIDS, meaning gays aren't the only ones spreading it.
-Three, gay marriage is not listed as a cause of exposure on this list, meaning it may or may not have any positive or negative effect on future statistics and your claim that gay marriage helps the spread of AIDS is invalid.
-Four, there exists a cause that spread AIDS faster than homosexual sexual contact (injected drug use).
Anyone can get HIV - young and old, men and women, straight, gay and bisexual, rich and poor, and all racial and ethnic groups - but not everyone faces the same risk. Your risk comes from what you do, and who you do it with - that is, how likely it is that the person you have sex or share needles with is infected. But even if you are part of a community with a high infection rate, you can avoid getting HIV. I think that was the purpose of the "Knowing is Beautiful" PSA campaign that went around last year.
You, sabrejimmy, asked for proof that gays are not spreading AIDS. Unfortunately, they are. And even more unfortunately so are heterosexuals. Healthy, monogamous relationships, whether homo- or heterosexual, are not putting a stop to this because the number is still way too high. Clean your needles and use condoms people.

'"there is no aspect of marital law that requires or inquires about fertility. Fertility and procreation have nothing to do with

"*That* is what I was saying"
Your contextualization of your quote doesn't help your case. There are two statements there. Either the second is independent of the first, in which no context was missing, or there is an implied logical relation. What is it? "Because fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law"? "Therefore fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law"? Neither of those changes the plain understanding of the statement "Fertility and procreation have nothing to do with current marriage law."
As strange as it is that you merely repeat the passage and claim an obvious alternate understanding, it is absurd that you should accuse me of setting that statement up as a straw man.
"I was *not* refuting your statement (which you made *after* I said the above, not before) that marriage law was influenced by procreation."
Speaking of context, I made a stronger version of the same statement in the last paragraph of my very first argument, which you discounted as a "sweeping generalization."
When I made the statement in its current formulation to clarify the premise I wanted you to accept, you reformulated it into a straw man claim (that governments conducted explicit statistical analysis to formulate optimal marriage laws) which you rejected.

"That you chose to quote and respond to that sentence
and ignore the other 7 tells me you are not arguing honestly."
No. You don't understand my argument.
Your other 7 sentences were part of your explanation, yes. But they were not facts that show that "facts are the antithesis of common sense." Some of them were general factual claims (not particular facts), and they merely suggested that sometimes facts and common sense contradict each other, which is distinct from a claim that common sense and facts are antithetical (cannot usefully coexist).
Even if your other 7 sentences were all facts which tended to prove the point you hoped to, it still wouldn't change the point that the particular sentence I quoted was an appeal to common sense, which you had said was the disease of arguments. And it wasn't just any appeal, either. It was an appeal acknowledging the very point I was making. That perhaps more argumentation could clarify, or more facts illustrate, a point, but at one point the hope is that the parties will have a common sense to what truth they are both willing to accept without further argumentation.

You do realize what a difficult criterion Pareto efficiency is to fulfill in a large society, don't you? Perfect Pareto efficiency fails if one person would have been better off without the law.

I'll leave speed limit, passport laws(?), and murder laws as an exercise for you to think about.
"So gay people don't deserve to be treated equally under the law because they can't be picked out of a crowd?"
You don't understand the difference between being treated equally under the law and equal protection scrutiny. White people get basically no scrutiny, but are still treated equally under the law. If you had bothered to read and think about what I said, you probably would understand.

Before you threw me completely off track, I criticized your *appeal* to common sense (first appearing on Feb 06 07:16, “The appeal to common sense is the last defense of those with no facts.”) as some kind of authority or reference. I wasn’t criticizing “common sense” (which would be stupid), but your reliance on it instead of facts, examples and logic.
Before you threw me completely off track, I pointed out that fertility is not an issue in current marriage law.

883,"gay marriage","Wow. I’m happy to see that you are really thinking on your own instead of repeating someone else’s tired arguments.
Regardless, I would like to rebut.
Your argument mainly relies on reluctance to redefining marriage. However, you have not acknowledged that marriage has been defined and redefined several times (not to mention that it currently has several definitions) and the world hasn’t come to an end.
In the USA it wasn’t that long ago that marriage was defined in legal terms. Then blacks were freed from slavery and created a new threat. So, marriage was redefined to make it illegal for blacks to marry whites. Then it was redefined again to allow it (by dropping the laws that made it illegal).
In the USA (as well as other parts of the world) there are some religions, such as the Mormons, that define marriage with more than one partner.
Don’t forget that the age of consent for marriage varies from state to state. You can already get legally married in some states at the age of 14. So, even parts of the definition vary.
Today, in other countries, marriage is still defined as ownership of the female. Because it is not this way in other countries, it also shows that marriage has been already redefined.
Also, some societies still define marriage as forced and/or arranged.
All of these illustrate that there is no one definition that everybody follows for marriage. Not even love is the common denominator.
The point is that societies are dynamic and changing. Just because you say that your common sense tells you something, simply means that it’s not right for you. It doesn’t mean that it’s not right for someone else.
That’s what most of this boils down to. Gays want to get married just like anyone else. But, some try to force their beliefs on others. They don’t want to recognize that just because something isn’t right for them, that it may be right for someone else.
I follow your logic about superheroes. But, I’m not clear as to why you include it. It seems to be counterproductive to your argument. It’s almost is if you are saying that 1 woman married to 1 man should be allowed to scoff at others that would like to be married; denying others marriage just so they can feel special.
You mention if gays could get married, it would be a slippery slope for bestiality folks and the pedophiles wanting their rights too. But, look around. If they wanted to marry, they would already be demanding their rights. I don't see children or horses lining up, protesting.
You have also failed to mention that the latest US census shows that less than 50% of American households are legally married couples. It doesn’t mean that they don’t exist or that they are less loving or less of a family. It simply means that they are not married - gay or not.
In conclusion, the world is an evolving place, whether you want to admit it or not. Plants evolve, animals evolve, the earth itself evolves and so do human societies, which includes the notion of marriage.

883,"gay marriage","There is no one definition of marriage.
In the USA it wasn’t that long ago that marriage was defined in
legal terms. Then blacks were freed from slavery and created a
new threat. So, marriage was redefined to make it illegal for
blacks to marry whites. Then it was redefined again to allow it
(by dropping the laws that made it illegal).
In the USA (as well as other parts of the world) there are some
religions, such as the Mormons, that define marriage with more
than one partner.
Don’t forget that the age of consent for marriage varies from
state to state. You can already get legally married in some
states at the age of 14. So, even parts of the definition vary.
Today, in other countries, marriage is still defined as ownership
of the female. Because it is not this way in other countries, it
also shows that marriage has been already redefined.
Also, some societies still define marriage as forced and/or
arranged.
All of these illustrate that there is no one definition that
everybody follows for marriage. Not even love is the common

828,"gay marriage","Where do you point the origin of marriage then?
Now to be more specific, where did the origin of marriage come from in the US?
As far as why it matters to me, it matters because based on my beliefs homosexuality is a sin. While people will continue practicing it despite what I think, I do not feel that a sin should be rewarded with the benefits of marriage. I also do not want the idea of marriage to become diluted even further. I will already have to explain to my kids why so many people get married/divorced multiple times and why people get married for just a day or two, I really don't want to have to explain to them why two guys or two girls are getting married.
Another question for you though, if marriage is about a vow of commitment, then why does it matter to you whether homosexuals can marry? I have made vows of commitment multiple times for various things and didn't require a legal institution.",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"
883,"gay marriage","OK.
To help determine the origin of marriage, we have to look at the written word itself. In our current and known societies, the Chinese have kept the best written records that predate the writing of the Bible.
Early on, Chinese couples were married in what is called an extra-clan marriage, or better known as antithetic marriage. This occurred during the New Stone Age, around 5000 BC.
Traditional Chinese marriage became a custom between 402-221 B.C.
Also, historically, many societies have allowed some form of polygamy. Europe, the United States and Canada have defined themselves as monogamous cultures. This came from Germanic cultural traditions, Christianity, and mandate of the Roman Law. However, Roman Law permitted prostitution, concubinage, and sexual access to slaves.
So, marriage of some kind is found in virtually every society throughout time and it’s difficult to pinpoint its exact origin. But, it is very clear that it existed long before Christianity was around. And it wasn’t until recently that it worked its way into Western and European law.
I probably won’t be able to change your mind about your belief that homosexuality is a sin. However, you do have to face the reality that it is a documented occurrence in over 211 species of mammals, 14 species of birds, 15 species fish, 32 species of other vertebrates and 70 species of insects and other invertebrates.
Also there are many religions that do allow gay marriage, including some sects of Christianity.
I’m sorry that you do not want to tell your children why some gays get married and why some couples get divorced in as little as a few hours of marriage. But, doing what we must do versus doing what we like to do is what makes us adults. Then again, if you don’t tell your children, they don’t stop learning, they’ll learn on their own from others.
Why does it matter to me if gays can get married? It’s simple. People do not like to be segregated, teased, taunted, humiliated or otherwise hurt. It’s hurtful when people point you out and then say you can or cannot do things because upon some trait. Didn’t you go to history class in school? The Jews didn’t like it in Nazi Germany. The Blacks didn’t like it when they had to sit in the back of the bus. Women didn’t like it when they couldn’t vote. People didn’t like it when blacks and whites couldn’t marry. People didn’t like it when they couldn’t drink alcohol.
We had laws about those things. Do you really believe that those laws were for (1) the benefit of society or (2) for religious purposes? Read your history. There were citations on both sides. But, that argument didn’t matter. Eventually, those things became some of the worst incidences in modern history.
Marriage is also about such things as survivorship, health insurance benefits, life insurance and seeing a loved one in a hospital. Current laws prohibit unmarried people from these things.
But, in spite of all of this, it still boils down to one thing. It’s wrong for you. So, you want to force your beliefs upon others.

828,"gay marriage","Chasbas,
You have done a very good job of explaining your position and I respect you for it.
For clarification, I have absolutely no personal problem with anyone who is homosexual. As mentioned before, I believe it is a sin, but on that same note I am a sinner as well and therefore do not judge anybody based on that but on who they are as a person and what they do with their life. I have had friends that were homosexual and family members as well. I treat them no differently than anyone else, they have different views than I do and make different choices.
There was one part of your response that I have to question. It is a common rebuttal to anyone who opposes gay marriage and that is the comparision between homosexuals and blacks.
The argument has one major assumption and that is people who use it believe that homosexuals are born that way and have no choice in the matter, that it is purely biological and hardcoded into your DNA. I do not believe this is the case and have yet to see any hard evidences to the contrary. I have seen studies done that suggest this, but nothing definitive. I beleive it is a chocie that people make, many have come out of the closet only later to decide that heterosexuality is what they prefer (see Anne Heche). Some might argue that this is the religious right pushing them that way and for many you would be right, but until this argument is settled I think comparing the homosexual's rights with civil rights is a little too much. Are we now going to have laws in place that force homosexuals into the workforce? Will the NBA now have to have X number of homosexual coaches each year? Comparing the homosexual issue with civil rights starts down a very slippery slope and anyone who decides to take that path should be careful before doing so.
Regarding how I will talk to my children about homosexuality. Inevitably, I will have to tell them the truth of the matter and based on the Bible it is a sin and that the government which was founded on many Christian values chose to ignore this one if homosexual's are allowed to marry one day.",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"
883,"gay marriage","You are correct. I do not believe that the Bible is an accurate or complete accounting of history. Every known religion has two things in common. They explain the unexplainable (such as the skies/heavens, oceans, the beginning of the world, the end of world and other things people had no explanation) and how to get along with each other. Religions vary widely as to the beginning of humans. So, if you don’t believe in science, how do you know which religion is correct about the beginning of humans? If it is questionable as to which religion is correct about the beginning of time, it also leads to the possibility that science is correct. Leaving that secondary debate, even Genesis does not mention that Adam and Eve were married.
You are also correct to say that there is no definitive evidence that anyone made a conscious decision to be gay, if they were born that way or if other factors are involved. There are two things we can point to for clarification. First, there are over 6 billion humans on Earth. It is estimated that between 1% to 10% are gay. That is 60 to 600 million people are gay. Only one to two hundred claim that they weren’t born that way or that they were able to change their sexuality. That leaves most others stating that they were born that way, it was the earliest feelings of attraction they can recall or they started dealing with it later in life but there were always signs of it. Second we look to the documented cases of homosexual/bisexual behavior within hundreds of species of other animals.
All of this points heavily to the idea that it is indeed a natural occurrence.
But, regardless of natural occurrence or not, you believe it is a sin. OK. I respect your belief for the Bible and that homosexuality is a sin. But, others don’t.
You state “… comparing the homosexual plight to Jews during the Holocaust is going a bit too far.” Not really. Please don’t forget that during that very same holocaust that the Jewish were not the only class of people being persecuted. Gay people were forced to wear pink triangles to identify them. They too were rounded up and placed in the same death camps to be executed. Others to be executed were the mentally ill and the disabled.
Do a little more digging into history and you can find in modern history where being gay in England often resulted in a punishment of life in prison breaking rocks.
You also state “No authority is abusing homosexuals and if it ever happens I will be one of the first denouncing them for their actions and defending homosexuals.” Yet Christianity is trying very hard to abuse homosexuals by denying rights, denying privileges, attempting to make it illegal, leading protests and attempting to discredit it wherever possible. And THAT thinking is the slippery slope that very slowly, but eventually lead the Jewish, gays, physically disabled and the mentally ill to be executed.
I meant it quite literally when I wrote “don't be the protector of what is right or wrong for me. But, be the defender of what is right or wrong for you...” It means that it understandable that you believe that being gay is a sin and that it is wrong. But, I mean for you to understand that it is a sin and wrong, for YOU. It is not a sin or wrong for a huge amount of other people. And that you should stop trying to force what you believe is right or wrong upon others (which seems to be the number one complaint against Christians in the United States).
I also wrote “…and those that cannot defend their self” to mean quite literally those that are forced against their will or people that cannot make a decision.

“Marriage” is *not* solely a religious word. As has been explained countless times before, the ritual of marriage began way before Judaism (and therefore Christianity). It was initially a financial and political transaction, and had nothing to do with love. Even now there are many religious groups that use marriage for those purposes, eschewing “love” in favor of religious laws.
Legal marriage, which is what is under discussion here, *is* a basic right to every citizen. You went to a pastor, but all you *had* to do was go to city hall, where your basic right can be exercised. For proof that this is a basic civil right, consider this example: a man and a woman go to city hall to get married and the clerk tells them that because one of them is black and the other is white, they are not permitted to legally marry. This *was* the law 50 years ago, and it was vigorously defended by religious and legal scholars, until finally that law was overturned and the civil right to marriage was extended to everyone regardless of their race.
However it was not extended to everyone regardless of their sex. *That* is what this issue is about.
Your pastor has the right to refuse to marry you, but the city clerk does not (except under very specific circumstances, like being related too closely).

Arranged marriages have been far more common than those "for love" because of the property issues. If marriage were primarily about "love" then it would never have been bound up with so many different laws.
As it is primarily about contractual agreements, there's no justification for reserving it for any particular class of people. Religion has no place in the matter, and the only place government should have is that which it has with regard to any OTHER civil contract.
That said, the gender of the people who enter into a marriage contract should be irrelevant. And, yes, the number of people who enter into such a contract should be irrelevant.
Any laws that pertain to marriage as anything but a civil contract should be removed immediately.
Issues pertaining to the welfare of children should be completely separate, as they really have nothing to do with marriage but are of legitimate concern to society. We all know that the presumption that a woman's child was fathered by her legal husband is ridiculous. All laws that differentiate between children born in and out of wedlock would be removed from the books. Old-fashioned laws that tie children to marriage treat children as a form of property/chattel.
DNA testing at birth should be mandatory for all children, in order to establish parentage as a fact. Lying about the parentage of a child on a birth certificate should be a felony, with guaranteed prosecution. Not knowing who the father is should only be acceptable in cases of reported rape.

The vast majority of homosexuals do not have any abuse in their background.

Gay marriage would protect children of gay couples, especially if one of the parents happens to fall ill or die. The children would have access to social security benefits, estate claims, etc… Gay couples have children, either together (with assistance) or from previous relationships and adoption.
By allowing these couples to marry legally, they can protect their children (and provide a good example of a committed relationship). A surviving partner has clear legal rights, responsibilities and commitments to the children they have a relationship with. Outside family members can't come in and attempt to take the children away from their surviving parent.
Being gay does not take away the ability to be a good loving parent. There are plenty of hetero parents who should not be allowed to be parents but no one holds a litmus test up for them before they are allowed to reproduce.

And if you really know your history you'd know that this country was founded because of people's desire to be able to freely practice any religion in their own fashion. It was around the time of the English Civil War that they were motivated to move to this land and declare independence. This is the reason that there is a clear separation of church and state and the reason that laws are not drafted by the church as was the case in England.
Also, consider the fact that a marriage in the United States is not recognized unless you get a marriage license from the state. This is not a Christian document. So even if a man and woman (in today's law) who aren't of your faith wish to get married, they can. And even if you have a Christian ceremony you're not married according to the law until you go to city hall and get your license.
So you're entitled to your beliefs, but religions don't make laws in this country and never have. And thank God for that. One last thing.

I don't think Gay Marriage is the answer to an equalization of rights. The best so far has been Domestic Partnership benefits (which, by the way, are made available to same-sex and opposite-sex couples). Perhaps Civil Unions are a close second best answer. The primary argument from the pro-gay marriage side is to allow two individuals, regardless of gender, the right to enjoy the benefits usually flowing from marriage, like ability to make medical decisions on behalf of a loved one, visit ailing partners in ICU, burial and visitation of a deceased partner (not in that order), taxation equal to households in similar economic situations. I raised two children to college age and was unable to claim them as allowances or as dependents on my income taxes because 1) I couldn't adopt them, 2) was not a biological parent, 3) foster parent was not an IRS status allowing one to claim a child you supported at that time. I was the only wage earner and provided 100% of their support for 10 years. I was over taxed and under-paid. Yet, the local school systems did not see the kids as eligible for reduced or free school lunches because... of my status as a person living in the household with them and because I made just above poverty level salary - just above the threshhold of household income eligibility. Go figure. I can, and it's a negative number. Seemed inequitable to me at the time, and I think that's the whole argument around gay marriage. Still - marriage (the institution and historic sense of the word) is not necessarily the answer. The civil liberties and economic benefits usually coming with marriage are the answer. Call it what you like (such as "Fair"), but not "marriage." One argument against Gay Marriage that I don't hear or see is: Court Systems and State Governments hope to avoid it, not for any moral reason, but because they can't handle the number of divorce actions in the superior courts today. It's simply math to them. No more room on the dockets!

And the idea that if "everyone" (an extreme statement since that's not reality) had a gay marriage we would become extinct is equally as absurd. Currently not "everyone" gets married at all and children are born out of wedlock, born to people who never have sex with their partner (surrogates, artificial insemination etc...).

672,"gay marriage","What's interesting is that the person you're replying to never mentioned incest at all. They referred to bestiality and pedophilia. And your belief that people "become" gay after molestation or doing ecstasy is probably one of the most ignorant and laughable things I've ever read in the last few years. People don't become gay anymore than they become straight. However you'd have to know and have a conversation with someone who's homosexual to understand this. I doubt you'll ever bring yourself to do anything like that as it's pretty clear that you've just been taught that this "abnormal" behavior is repulsive.",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"
672,"gay marriage","I'll concede there are cases of people who are themselves confused and most likely not truly homosexual to begin with or made to feel so guilty about who they really are (by people like yourself) that they choose to convincingly hide or mask their true nature. Those people do exist and I've met some myself. That's who you're encountering.
However to say that there is some "cure" for homosexuality merely reinforces that you have a limited exposure to the broader cross-section of the people we're talking about here.
And although you'd like to think so, I didn't blindly convince myself of any of this. I've had and continue to have friends and family members who are gay and I've had long discussions with them about it. I can tell you with certainty that at no time did they choose their preference anymore than you chose yours. Many of them are made to feel guilty for how they feel and I even know a few who have been through programs like the one you describe. They do this because they're told they should be ashamed of who they are. But in the end they cannot shake the reality that they are gay and cannot choose to live in direct contradiction of that.
And again your weak analogies are almost funny. Measles are not an equivalent to homosexuality. You can't catch it. If sexual preference was a virus or bacteria (which is what your statement suggests) then you're also saying that heterosexuality is an infection but merely a different strain.
I don't enjoy sin. I simply define it differently. Now I'm sure you believe homosexuals live in some kind of "sin" due to your religious beliefs, but that's your "choice" to believe these things. Don't tell me it's empirically sinful. Sin is a relative idea and I certainly don't share your view of sin in this case.
Obviously we're not going to change each others minds through this discussion, but you'd probably be better served if you stuck to the actual topic rather than throwing little insults my way like asking if my father wasn't around. Seriously? That's what you came up with?
I looked over some of your other replies here and while I never expect to find the most dignified people on the net, for a "counselor" you sure do speak to people with the flair of an angry high-school child. Fighting to get your opinion heard and insulting people along the way.
To try to bring it back to the actual topic at hand... In the end gay marriage will be legalized. There were people just like yourself who fought against interracial marriage not so long ago on the basis that it was immoral and sinful and redefined traditional marriage. Eventually the majority of people came to understand otherwise (as do most people who've weighed in on this topic here). Because thankfully under the law, your version of Christianity isn't the final say on what defines right and wrong.",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"
672,"gay marriage","It's official, you've proved that all you're capable of is avoiding any points I make on this subject and regurgitating some of the most stereotypical misguided information on the planet. I'll put aside your inability to write properly formed sentences and focus on the rest of it for now.
I'm not sure where you're pulling these statistics from, but 3% is a gross underestimation of the reality. In California, Prop 8 only passed by a small margin. Those against it made up 47.9% of the voting populous. Similar numbers can be seen in any state where such measures have been on the ballot and there are 2 states that legally recognize gay marriage already. It's hardly 3%.
Now this idea you have about an "agenda" or "manifesto" reads like the beginning of a crass sketch in a comedy show. The only thing I've ever heard from any homosexual friend of mine is that they'd like to be left alone to live their life and treated fairly and equally under the law. Where you came up with this concept of combining that with pedophilia is beyond me, but at this point your ignorance isn't surprising me anymore. My only "personal" manifesto is to see to it that as many people who believe what you do are enlightened and come to understand that judgment and hatred aren't good qualities in anyone, much less a self-proclaimed Christian. Which brings me to your ramblings about AIDS.
Yet again your statistics are completely wrong. The number one way of contracting AIDS heterosexual contact, not homosexual. You'd know this if you spent any time with patients of the disease or those who care for them. Or if you just went to the local library. But in your mind it's probably the "gay" disease so you stay away. Here's a quote from the CDC... "The majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual relations between partners, one of whom has HIV. The primary mode of HIV infection worldwide is through sexual contact between members of the opposite sex."
I'm sure you came up with this 60% number from general bigotry and perception rather than simply looking it up or reading about it from those who actually treat the epidemic.
And I love how you have to insinuate that I myself must be gay to be defending gay rights to such a degree. You can make whatever assumptions make you feel comfortable, but I'm not gay. I simply subscribe to a belief where condemnation of other people isn't a form of therapy to make myself feel more entitled to going to heaven. Also, whether or not the Christian faith makes up a large percentage of the country isn't an issue for me. On the whole Christianity contains sound guidance for living life. It's your form of Christianity that bothers me. The one of judgment, ignorance, and hatred. Most of the Christians I know don't agree with the drivel you write. And if popular opinion were always equivalent to what is "right" then we'd still be living in a segregated society that thinks the world is flat. So telling me I'm in the minority (even though that's a by a tiny margin) isn't going to have any effect on me.

Again no link, but after doing a search I found (aidscouncil dot org) and after searching extensively I don't see anything regarding your statistic. In fact I see plenty to the contrary. They actually defer to the CDC, which I both cited and quoted in my reply.
Your statement "The only way a heterosexual gets aids is from a homosexual affair or the spouse is having a homo affair or blood trasfusion" shows me that you're living in a cave. The highest transmission of AIDS in the world is through hetereosexual contact. Here's another exact source for you where the World Health Organization says..."The World Health Organization estimates that heterosexual transmission has accounted for 75% of the HIV infections in adults world-wide."
Here's the source:
World Health Organization, The HIV/AIDS pandemic: 1993 Overview, Geneva, World Health Organization, 1993, Publication No. WHO/GPA/CNP/EVA/93.1.
Maybe in your secluded sector of the US the numbers vary, but I can asssure you that AIDS itself is not just the gay disease you make it out to be. And then you leap back to some reference to blood banks in 1986? You do realize 22 years has gone by? Here are some more up to date stats for you to ponder... "Nearly all people infected with HIV through blood transfusions received those transfusions before 1985. In August 1995, the FDA recommended that all donated blood and plasma also be screened for HIV-1 p24 antigen. The U.S. blood supply is currently among the safest in the world."
Yes, in some developing countries these things are still an issue because testing of the blood supply isn't on the same level as developed nations.
Your IQ level isn't reflective of the amount of knowledge you've been exposed to. Since IQ doesn't equate to actual information, only the ability to learn it, I don't see what your IQ has to do with this discussion. You still often fail to write properly structured English sentences and you've shown me no evidence whatsoever to support any of this drivel. You're just pulling statements out of the air about gay agendas and pedophelia, but it's all crazy talk. The largest gay/lesbian organization that tries to advance gay rights is GLAAD and I don't see anything on their web site about associations with pedophiles or any agenda that would effect your life in any way.
And where's this evidence that gay people want multiple partners when they're married? You've shown me nothing to support that. I'm not telling you "what a gay friend told me" - I'm telling you what I know to be the mentality of most homosexual people I've come in contact with. In fact, I know more heterosexual people who have open marriages than any homosexuals. I haven't referred to "a friend" I've been telling you (if you use your IQ to read) that I have several friends and family members. I like to avoid self-induced ignorance (unlike yourself) so I actually have conversations with them about these things. In fact I've shared this conversation with a couple of them. Also, if I were gay, I certainly wouldn't hide it. And I definitely wouldn't pretend not to be on an anonymous web site.
So my "evidence" is rather broad.

915,"gay marriage","Those studies are certainly troubling. However, it is not sensible to use them to argue against extending marriage rights to LGBT people. There are two main premises underlying your argument. The first of these is that the relative health risks of anal sex constitute a sign that it is deemed unhealthy by a divine being. The reason that the argument presupposes the existence of some sort of diety is that, if this god is nonexistent, then the focus should be on solving human problems, rather than worrying about what God thinks.
Your argument also assumes that this deity shows us its preferences by making this safer, while making that less safe. By this logic, oral sex should be the type that is most beloved of the Deity. This is one of the two main types of intercourse for gay men, and the only primary one for gay women. Of course, the opponents of homosexuality ignore lesbians, because they do not take women seriously, and because they think that there must be a man involved in order for it to really be sex. Another problematic implication is that childbirth, among the most natural and beautiful things in existence, would be deemed dirty, because in a more 'natural' pre-modern setting, a very high percentage of women would pay the ultimate price for giving life. Of course, I am not arguing that childbirth is anything less than a beautiful thing. Taken on balance, childbirth is clearly necessary and good. I am only pointing out that there is no reason that God would make the best of things the most perilous. Here we see the impressively unbalanced way in which gay marriage's opponents apply the 'ain't safe, ain't right' rule. The second problem with these arguments is that they always seem to assume that irresponsible sexual behavior is an inherent part of the LGBT community. For one thing, this ignores the fact that, controlling for the difference in marriage rights, heterosexuals have been every bit as irresponsible as their homosexual counterparts, ever since the first hominines decided that sex feels good. I readily admit that a segment of the LGBT community engages in relatively high levels of risky behavior, and that based on your evidence, committed gay couples may need to be more careful. However, this certainly does not mean that the culture of that certain segment of the gay community cannot be changed, or that committed gay couples cannot be made more aware of these risks. As for why some gay people behave in irresponsible ways, it is for two main reasons. The first is straight out of social psych 101, which tells us that labeling the defining characteristic of a certain group of people as deviant is not a good way for l'Infame to achieve his objective. Not only will it obvously not stop homosexual intercourse, but it has the effect of making some parts of the gay community engage in the same irresponsible practices that the mainstream assumes them to engage in. This is partly as parody, like with in some Pride parades. It is also partly because gay people are forced to buy into the worldview of conservatives, because they are the ones that have traditionally had the power to define. When the dominant class tells a person that he or she is sick, that person tends to believe it.

You are making irrational jumps of opinions that are based not on what you would call common sense, but merely prejudice. What is the "idea" of marriage? let's be honest, even though many people might not have wanted it to, the idea of marriage evolves with every generation. When King Henry couldn't have any male heirs, he created divorce (a very large slam against the "idea" of marriage in my opinion.) It used to be that males had guardianship over their wives, until women moved for equal rights. There's also the point that in marriage you are going to be in a lifetime commitment to one person. How did that work out? 50% percent of first marriages, 67% of second and 74% of third marriages end in divorce, according to Jennifer Baker of the Forest Institute of Professional Psychology in Springfield, Missouri. Stop using the "sanctity of marriage" as an excuse not to give equal rights. It's getting boring.
Marriage has already become a symbol head for what most people see it as today. Love. When you love someone, you get married. That has become the two things linked together. So, take another look at your common sense meter. It's compass must be a little off.

I myself am straight, but I believe that two people no matter what sex should be allowed to be married. Marriage isn't about religion it is something provided by a country/state to provide the unification of two people that love each other and would like to spend their lives together. If religion is so against it then don't allow gay marriages in the church, temple, or wherever you go to worship, but by all means gay marriage should be allowed in a way that has nothing to do with religion. Marriage is often performed just by someone of the state that has the privilege to marry two people together and that marriage has nothing to do with religion. Our country was made on the basis of freedom to be who you want to be and worship what you want to worship. This is the reason our country was made; so that religion would not enter the way we form our laws. Also to all religious people if you believe that God chooses our life and creates who we are. Then isn't he the one that made a person gay, isn't he the person that created that sexual orientation, and made it so that a person is allowed to like who they like? If a person decides to or is born to love and be attracted to someone of the same sex, why should they not be allowed to? It is wrong for someone to tell YOU as your own individual to tell you how to live your life;just as it is wrong for you to tell someone else how they should or shouldn't live their life. If they are attracted to the same sex did anyone give them a choice when they were born who they wanted to be attracted to? No, they were born that way and have no way to refuse the urge of liking someone of the same sex. Why are you attracted to the opposite sex? Because you were born that way. You may have your own opinion about something but that opinion shouldn't dictate how someone can or can't live their life. Homosexual people deserve the same rights heterosexual people have when they decide they want to spend the rest of their life with someone. You telling someone who they can and cannot marry is discrimination. This is the same as me telling you that you can't marry my white family member because you aren't white.

However, many teenagers who get pregnant didn't truly love their partners, just as many couples who truly love each other can not reproduce children due to infertility problems. According to your statement, any couple that cannot reproduce does not love one another, but reproduction is not needed for love, therefore homosexual people still can access the purpose of love. Your statement of "as long as it stays a minority then it will be fine" leads me to believe that you are worried more about losing control of the population of homosexuals than about "not hating them", and that once you see them as a "threat to society", you will let them live almost normally, but once they start growing in numbers this will change.

To answer your point, while it is true that many genes can skip generations, it is still impossible for a "homosexual gene" to progress this way. The second that a homosexual gives in to this "gene", he removes himself from the so-called "gene pool". Therefore, such an argument still doesn't hold water in the face of SEXUAL reproduction. The genes MUST re-enter the HETEROSEXUAL gene pool in order to be passed along.

Even before I realized I was a member of the LGBT community myself, I stood up for the rights of the ones who just want to love.
First of all, most of the time people will bring up the "it's unholy" , "this is not what god wanted" and I'll admit, he put male and female on this world to reproduce, and in the bible it also states that two people should not get married for love, but to reproduce. Let me say this, people everywhere are okay with the older generation of people to get married, they obviously can't have kids! But then people don't bring up the whole bible bit.
Another thing, I know a lot of people have used this one, but seriously, how does gay marriage hurt YOU. How does it affect anything in YOUR life? Just because it's out-of-the-ordinary doesn't mean it should be frowned upon. It's sad to say, people would rather see two guys holding guns than holding hands.
You see all these happy male-female couples walking down the street holding hands, happy. But the moment a male-male/female-female couple comes walking around there HAS to be something wrong? They're happy, you're happy. What difference does that make?

856,"gay marriage","A transition to the term "civil union" becomes more or less a definitional debate. It is inherently impossible for the government (as a regulatory body) to dictate exactly what marriage is due to its subjective nature. Religion dictates marriage, not society in general.
Having said that, you don't make a clear differentiation here. Yes marriage is motivated by religion. However, the conceptualization of civil unions in essence supports the advocacy for gay rights. Changing the term "marriage" strips the religious opposition enveloping the nature of the situation. Biblical text is definitional; marriage is between a male and female as per the Catholic Church, not a civil union. So in effect, the entire moral encompassing framework becomes secularized and the rights are broadened to members of the LGBT. By advocating for a civil union rather than a marriage, you are supporting the true nature of civil rights recognition in the gay rights movement. The argument is thus counterproductive and the pro side wins.",8,0,"Allowing gay marriage is Right"
913,"gay marriage","I see the problem with people fighting the idea of "gay anything" more of a issue of sex acts, than anything else. It doesn’t matter if the argument is religion, political, social or simple opinion. When you talk to people who are against anything to do with "GAY", or even some that are for people of this "nature", it is equated to the act of sex.
Baring any of my own personal, religious, political or social convictions, I support this idea. Understanding that there is probably a bit of bias working here. My mother has been an open lesbian since I was 7. Im 43 now. Beyond those who are "Gay", Those of us raised by gay people, in a gay environment, around others of the same diversity are probably the best source for both sides of the equation. With that said.
OPINION= If the general population could forget the act of sex and think of the emotion involved, they may better be able to determine the best course of action in these matters.
SOCIAL= Being raised by lesbians, I find myself more acceptant of this lifestyle for women, yet I find myself having difficulties accepting the homosexual male version. But I only have these difficulties when the act of sex enters the equation. When I think of two people who love one another, I find it refreshing that in this day and age anyone can find and maintain true love.
RELIGION= I often believe that since we are created by one God, who is of sprit and does not have the need for procreation, then that God would not have sexual organs. And as the creator of both man and woman, instilling an innate desire for companionship and love, who expects that love be a covenant between two people, he would not truly concern himself with the physical disposition of those people. As far as matters of the bible, yes it says many wise and profound things. It has many lessons, and tells of the many experiences and even is presented as a life’s guide based on the teachings of Christ. However, as we all know, as with religion the bible has been manipulated by many and interpreted and perceived in so many ways. All for what man thinks that God expects of man. But we can all agree that the bible teaches us acceptance, tolerance, love, forgiveness and what I believe to be the least acknowledged but most important, spirituality. A relationship with the creator based on the true love of a creator, and mutual love for that creators children and creations. Man is the one who gets it wrong in this and many matters of God and the bible.
POLITICAL= Simply put, our government is not in any way thread by gays or gay marriage anymore than it is by we heterosexuals being married. Our way of life as Americans is in no way threatened. Hell our country was built by closet homosexuals long before this issue came up, and will continue to be even after this plight is over and all Americans has equal rights in America.
The jerk in me says: Although I have never felt any need to explore any type of relationship with a man, I would encourage those of you who fight this, to go out and get to know a gay person, couple or family. Give it some time to see what they are really about. Then when you “think” you get it, get off your high horse and do the right thing. Because in reality its none of your business, only your own short comings that keeps your mind closed. Legalize the marriage of two people who love one another. Don’t fight because of the thoughts you have about what they do in the bedroom.

103,"gay marriage","What exactly is your definition of marriage? Because marriage doesn't have to be some finite idea. That's really all marriage is: an idea. Ideas are the most malleable things in the world, and if it's a good thing, or possibly if it's a bad thing, the idea can be changed. Every idea is completely in our heads, so the only way marriage is the way you see it is because you see it that way. Other people have a different idea of marriage. whether people or animals or objects get married or not, they still love each other, and they'll still love each other the day after marriage as they did the day of the marriage as they did the day before as they did the week before, or however long ago they met their significant other. The actual action of marriage is simply a public proclamation of love that our society has come to accept means people truly love each other. And gay relationships are are just as wholesome as straight relationships (well, some straight relationships). Whether you let gays marry, they will still love each other. So, really, the whole argument of anti-gay marriage is kind of silly, because you are only removing one tool of their proclamation of love. They still show their love for each other, quite often in public by holding hands, or kissing, or simply displaying in some way that they are indeed gay, and they of course, as anyone does, show their love for each other in private ways as well. So really, I don't see why you would cling to this one aspect of love proclamation.

Basically what most anti gay marriage people are most worried about is that gay unions will lead the US down an immoral road and expose society to the "wrongs" of homosexuality. This got me thinking, and this isnt my stance or anything but in this debate i'd prefer you all to focus on these two things.
1. Anti Gay Marriage- Not all people believe that homosexuality is moral. That doesnt make them racist or ignorant, most of the time these thoughts are also contingent with the phrase "hate the act, not the person". Many people are afraid that this new institution will be the beginning to a road of very public homosexuality, whether it be in tv shows, movies, books, children's media, etc...If parents truly believe that homosexuality is morally wrong, are their fears truly not justified?
2. Pro Gay Marriage- To those parents afraid of homosexuality to their children, it should be known that no one will force a child or other person for that matter to be gay. if people dont like what they see on tv they should change the station. Whether everyone likes it or not, open gayness is becoming more and more acceptable in modern day society and gay people are slowly but surely being treated better, as well they should be.

None of the gay people I know could be stopped from being gay any more than I could be stopped from having attraction to members of the opposite sex. And what about bisexuals? Where do they fit in according to your analysis?
You also disproved your own point of homosexuality being unnatural by saying it may serve as a minor form of population control. So I'm not sure why you lean towards thinking there's something wrong with homosexuality--you haven't provided any good reasons why it would be wrong, other than the current societal mentality, which doesn't prove anything.",8,0,"No, at this day and age they are being intolerant"
3320,"gay marriage","Most likely the purpose you just mentioned, which was basic population control. As for current societal mentality, I was referring to what you said in the post I was responding to. Here's your quote:
"For most people there is this mentality instilled in us that Boys Like Girls, not Boys like Boys or Girls like Girls. It just goes agaisnt our instincts to accept anything otherwise."
It sounded to me like you were speaking in present tense, so I said "current societal mentality" in response to your words. You're correct in the historical analysis you've provided, although even today, while homosexuals aren't generally persecuted the way they used to be, there's still the belief that homosexuality is abnormal. You pointed that out in the quote I referenced above. We call heterosexual people "straight"; what's the opposite of straight? Crooked. We essentially view homosexuals as crooked. I'm not trying to sit on my high horse as I say this, as I've used "straight" in my vocabulary on numerous occasions. Nonetheless, this analysis is useful in proving the point you made about the subtle views society has about gays. My point was that just because the general societal views of the time say homosexuality is abnormal, doesn't prove that it actually is.
Also, once again, I'm curious as to your views on bisexuality.",8,0,"No, at this day and age they are being intolerant"
3320,"gay marriage","Thanks for sharing your honest views. I, on the other hand, see bisexuality as perfectly normal. In fact--this may surprise you--I see bisexuality as possibly being more normal than full heterosexuality or full homosexuality. Bisexuality was quite common in Ancient Greece and Rome, and occurred throughout China and Japan as well. It makes perfect sense why ancient Greek soldiers would have sexual relations with each other in addition to their female companions; as my ninth grade social studies teacher put it, if you love the guy next to you, you'll fight harder. As for modern times, Alfred Kinsey developed the Kinsey scale ranging from 0 to 6, with 0 being completely heterosexual and 6 being completely homosexual. The Klein sexual orientation grid takes this a little further.
I'm still unclear as to specifically why you seem consider homosexuality, and therefore bisexuality, to be immoral. You say you haven't been around enough bisexuals to have a full understanding, but this brings up another important issue. How do you know who's a bisexual? No one, even in today's semi-egalitarian society, can "see" whether or not someone's bisexual. Here's what I mean: when most people see two members of the same sex kissing on the street, what do they think? "Hey, look at that homosexual couple." When most people see two members of opposite sexes kissing , what do they think? "Hey, look at that heterosexual couple." Not many people stop to think that one or both of the kissers in either scenario could be bisexual.

Also, marriage is not just a religious institution (especially to those who choose to marry, who are not religious), and the common law requires no particular ceremony to validate the celebration of marriage.

3964,"gay marriage","10 reasons gay marriage is wrong:
1. its not natural, and if you're a real American, you reject everything unnatural like glasses, polyester, air conditioning, etc.
2. if we let people be gay, it will encourage others to be gay. i mean, when i hang out with tall people i become taller.
3. legalizing gay marriage might open the door for anybody and anything getting married. like if a guy wanted to get married to their dog, cause dogs have the same legal standing as humans; they can vote, sign legally binding contracts, etc.
4. we haven't changed marriage for so long, why start now? women are still property, blacks and whites can't get married and divorce is still illegal, so why change?
5. straight marriage will become less meaningful, think about it: something like Brittany Spears 55 hour wedding would just lose its validity, and no one wants that.
6. straight marriages are naturally more valid because they can procreate. after all, that is the only reason we get married. so gay marriages, infertile marriages, old marriages, they just don't need to happen. and its not like our orphanages are full or anything.
7. if we have gay marriages, those couples would raise gay children, and why would we want that? if you look at it, straight parents only raise straight children. the logic is sound.
8. gay marriage isn't supported by most religions, and in a theocracy like ours the values of one religion are imposed on all. that's why we only have one religion in America, so we all believe exactly the same things.
9. children will only succeed if they have a male and a female role model at home. that's the main reason why we ban single parent homes in America. we just don't let that happen.
10. gay marriage would change the foundation of society. we can never adapt to new social norms. stuff like cars, the service sector economy, longer life spans. why would we want to change and evolve? that's not what humans are.",8,0,right

This provision allows a family member or friend to officiate the wedding.) There are Humanist wedding officiants that provide secular marriage ceremonies without any religious ties, which actually make the wedding more personalized as each service is personally written, and includes Humanist values of equality and respect and commitment.
If marriage was just a religious thing, then only the religious would be able to do it right?

democracy - government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system

I realize that the United States use Federal principals. I was not trying to redefine the government, but as my quotes demonstrate, the US is accurately, if not precisely, described as a democratic republic.
And I would completely agree that the constitution secures rights for all, regardless of the majority. Those rights are defined by the constitution, which is why the freedom of speech is secured (as you point out). The national constitution does not yet secure such rights about marriage. In addition, there is processes for amending constitutions (national and state), which had bearing on the supreme court question (it was not a decision about minority rights).
As for your final questions, I would argue that there are no 'extra rights,' even if we consider marriage a right. All people in the US have the 'right' to marry someone of the opposite gender. There is no discrimination with such a right (all possess it). You misapplied the concept of 'extra' rights. What is being desired for by the minority, in regard to this issue, is an extension of this 'right' so that all would have the 'right' to marry someone of either gender. This is why definitions are so important to debates (such as here: what constitutes a right, equality, marriage, etc.?).

"The argument from human nature is absurd, because it's natural for some humans to be gay or bi. It would be unnatural to force such people into traditional marriages."
There is no credible evidence for your claim that it is "natural" for some humans to be gay or bi. And Prop 8 does NOT force anyone into traditional marriage. I don't know if you live in California or not, but I do, so I know that a homosexual couple who have a civil union would have the same rights as a traditional heterosexual married couple.
"The US is a democracy based on civil rights that protect minorities from the majority. That's why proposition h8 is fundamentally against the Constitution."

Leviticus (and other books of the Old Testament) contain myriad instructions and prohibitions governing the treatment of slaves, modes of dress and grooming, behavior on the Sabbath, and the consumption of food and drink.
These Biblical rules get ignored for two main reasons:
1) Most of them simply don't apply to modern society. We don't have slaves, it's impractical to inspect all of your clothing to make sure it's only made from one type of fiber, and try stoning a witch to death--just try it. The laws simply don't work for the way we fit in the world anymore, and so even the most die-hard of Christians have largely let them go. The difference with homosexuality is that most people don't want to break those "rules", and so it's easy for the majority to say that they should remain in place. It's kind of like making a law against duct-taping yourself to the wall: it's absolutely wrong, but it's tough to mobilize the majority of people to care enough to oppose it.
2) Jesus' coming is widely believed to supersede all of the laws set forth in the Old Testament. That's why super-observant Jews still keep kosher and refrain from cutting the hair that grows over their temples, but super-observant Christians don't. Unfortunately for homosexuals, there are still plenty of "Christians" like you out there who "just really hate" the idea of homosexuality, so that part of the Old Testament still gets quoted as if you all actually care what the books say.
Love thy neighbor; judge not lest ye be judged; let him without sin cast the first stone; consider the beam in thine own eye. Quit hiding behind your religion and pay more attention to the model of behavior it actually sets for you. Do you really think that Jesus would prefer a hypocrite over a homosexual?",8,0,"Yes it should"

If your spouse is terminal, you can make decisions. If your partner works for the city, state, county government, you may have a problem being covered on their insurance, and you may have trouble collecting death benefits. This is only some of the problems that people in civil unions face. In some states you can not buy a house together, a car together, cannot adopt children together. However, you can be foster parents. Common sense says if you are okay to be a foster parent, you do not change when you become an adoptive parent. The differences between marriage and civil union are so many that they are the innumerable. To people that are married by civil union being "married in a sense" is an insult and wrong in so many ways. No I am not gay. I am actually a born again Christian. HOWEVER, my God expects me to treat everyone with His love. He is the judge of what is wrong and what is right. I may not totally agree with certain lifestyles, but they do not affect me personally, and the lifestyle lived is between God and the people living the lifestyle. Why must we constantly want to do God's job for Him? His directive is to love the sinner, hate the sin, not judge the sinner for his sin. I know we live in the real world of tragedy and horrible crimes. God's directive also addresses this. We are to use man's law to correct these tragedies. These are two different scenarios and should not be addressed the same way. Common sense (which many lack,) should be the deciding factor as to which area the action committed belongs.

What makes Rape immoral: Is not consensual, Traumatizes the victim, Causes harm, Can spread STD’s, Can cause unwanted pregnancy, and it is not Justifiable.
What Justifies Imprisonment: yes the men or women who are imprisoned will likely undergo some sort of trauma but they are imprisoned for breaking the laws like committing rape. There is punishment for crimes. Punishment is justifiable to a degree. Prisoners still hold basic rights, but they forfeit a number of them when they commit a crime.
Both hurt people yes, and if that was the intent behind both then both would be wrong. Rape is not justifiable, imprisonment is, theres your difference.

But the fact is some people believe that your rules, supposedly set in stone, are in fact false. Unless you can provide definitive proof that god exist's and sponsored the writing of the bible, you cannot attack the rights of others. Imagine if scientologists started taking more and more seats of representation, and started outlawing the institution of marriage because their religion stated your practices were wrong. You would be most unhappy about being prevented from practicing your personal religious beliefs. Yet you propose a double standard, you think you have the right to define religion for everyone. Once again, I argue, what about homosexual christians (or homosexuals of any relligion) who have decided that their god has made them attracted to the same sex for a reason. Or what about homosexual and heterosexual atheist's who have decided that marriage has nothing to do with religion for them but is a practical method for being legally linked to another person. To deny other interpretations of religion (including their interpretations of marriage), as well as atheist's rights to purely non-theistic marriages, you are supporting religious intolerance. If you support religious intolerance, you are ignorantly inviting attacks against being able practice YOUR religion as well. I don't support taking away your right to observe your religious beliefs, even though I feel your beliefs partially lead to suppression of other peoples right's. Instead of supporting laws against your religion I simply try to convince you that my opinion holds more truth than your's. I may not be right, but at least YOUR rights aren't endangered by MY personal beliefs or actions. So, basically, think about how your support to limit other's right's, further bolster's support to limit everyone's rights, including your's. It's the Slippery Slope theory. We suppress more and more rights, and before you know it, everyone rises up against what you support. Taking away one liberty endangers them all.

There are actually some far-left elements that have made noise about incest, polyamory, and even bestiality, but I doubt they'll ever gain much ground.
A) None of these sexual preferences, so far as I know, are widespread or genetically inherited. So any "pro-incest" cause would be unlikely to draw popular support. Most folks have a gay friend. Few have a pal that's sleeping with his sister.
B) Incest, and polyamory, unlike gay marriage, destabilize the family unit.

2,"gay marriage","Why is gay marriage ok and incest not? Are you seriously asking that? We do not need to do a better job looking at that. Incest has the potential to hurt people. Children born out of incest have a much higher likelihood of defects and the more closely you are related to a person, the more likely you both carry a recessive trait (usually negative).
Gay marriage hurts no one. If I am straight and I marry a woman, the two guys getting married across the hall has no effect on my life or my marriage. The only argument that is made against gay marriage is that the bible says it's not ok. Well the west is a set of secular countries, so religion has no place in law making.
Legalizing gay marriage has no affect on anything, other than the happiness of the gay people getting married. It's not like way more people will decide to enter a gay marriage. Gay people are born the way they are, they're not going to convince others. And you know what else, I think the current set of gender roles could use some alterations.

Why is incest different? Easy. Hurts people. When I said it before, I wasn't talking only about incest rape, I was talking about consenting adults conceiving children. Sure the father daughter couple didn't have a kid yet. *Yet*. Not fair to the child. Too high a risk of defects and recessive traits being realized. Also, people may not want to admit it, but even when we're grown up, our parents are capable of influencing us. The relationship may look "consenting" but who knows what happened in the past. All this sounds like it could open the door for daughter-diddlers to rationalize their behaviour by saying they'll "make an honest woman out of her when she's all growed up".
Polyamoury is completely fine in my books. There is nothing wrong with those relationships as long as everyone is well informed. The difference between poly and gay marriage is the legal fiasco the former would cause. Marriage is basically a legal agreement. There would be no way to wade through the legalities in time, when looking for the person to make the decision about the husband in the coma.
Two easy solutions.
People do make that argument about development. The argument is worthless. It's based on the assumption that firm gender roles are important. Why are gender roles important? If two woman can raise a boy to be diligent, honest, and moral, where's the problem? He won't like guns and sports? Hell, maybe he will. Keep in mind that most of the people studying the 'abnormal' children of gay couples are thinking of those rigid, 1950s gender roles.",8,0,Yes
2,"gay marriage","Incest is not acceptable because one is not considered to be of sound mental or emotional health when one sexually desires one's close relative. Think about raising someone, changing their diapers, teaching them to walk, and then think about having sex with that same person. Really? You're going to put that in the same category as two unrelated people just because they're of the same sex?
I've read plenty of articles that show that children of same sex couples turn out as well developed as those of hetero couples. One study tested 500 families, and found that being raised by a gay couple had no negative effect on self-esteem or gender identity.
You have to understand that even if there were an effect on gender roles, this only represents a problem if current gender roles are perfect. I'm suggesting that they're not. Our current conception of gender is in the process of changing. In past configurations, there was no place for the LGBTT community. Things still aren't perfect for them.
I did read one study that found higher levels of depression in children of gay couples. But this was caused by them living in an anti-gay state. One thing that cleaving to these antiquated notions of gender roles will ensure is that these anti-gay states will remain the same. Change isn't easy and it's not always fun. Lots of people in the south weren't happy with the civil rights movement. But you know what? Too bad. It's the same situation (obviously minus the legacy of slavery, but there are plenty of anti-gay hate crimes). It's nothing new; LGBTT people have always existed, so why should they not be accepted.
No one believes that parents aren't capable of raising an adopted son/daughter of a different race. And if anyone does believe this, then they are rightly called a racist. Anti-miscegenation laws were thought to be a good idea until people realized that they weren't. It is wrong to bar someone from marrying someone of another race, just like it is wrong to bar someone from marrying someone of whatever sex they choose. Sexual preference is biologically determined. There is no gene that means that from birth, you will only be sexually compatible with your relatives, or only with multiple people. Laws in place that prevent LGBTT from seeking legal marriage (not civil unions or some other cop-out) only serve to keep that segment of the population from being truly equal members of society.",8,0,Yes
2,"gay marriage","All I want from you is some acknowledgment that maybe gay marriage is acceptable. Over the course of this whole thing, you've gone from (as I see it) arguing against gay marriage on the grounds that it opens the door for other things, to arguing in support of incestuous marriage. I don't care about incestuous marriage. Not right now anyway. I think that there are issues with it, such as the consanguinity of the parents, and potential for abuse.
I do not see any potential for abuse in legalizing gay marriage. If you want to start a debate about incestuous marriage, be my guest. One of the main reasons I do not accept lumping gay marriage in with incestuous marriage, is the massive cultural taboo associated with incest. There are reasons for this taboo, but the justification for the taboo is not at issue.
There Is no justification (other than religious, which should be irrelevant to law-makers) for a taboo against gay marriage. There is a gay gene. There is not an i-have-the-hots-for-my-sister gene. Maybe some people who are incestuous relationships are healthy, maybe they aren't; It's not relevant. All gay people in relationships are healthy, or are as likely to be healthy as hetero couples. This is why, when I make the argument that incestuous relationships may be a sign of imperfect mental health, I am *not* making the same argument as bigots who call LGBTT 'unhealthy'.

2,"gay marriage","I wasn't trying to offend anyone, but I don't really consider a religious defence of marriage to be acceptable. It's these people's happiness and basic human rights at stake. There is no messing around with that stuff. The supreme court exists partly so amendments are interpreted correctly. If gay marriage were made legal, the amendment would have to prohibit incestuous marriage and polygamy at the same time. That stuff is for someone else to sort out later, and should be treated as unrelated to the issue.
My point of view is that gay people are not any different from straights, therefore they should have all of the same rights. From this view, anyone trying to stop them from realizing the same rights that I have, is discriminating. Bigotry is the word I would use for this type of discrimination, like racism is what anyone would call it if it were directed at someone of a different race.
To deny a person a right is to deny that they are the same as you, and that they are therefore, not as valuable as you are. I do not think it is uncharitable to refer to someone that seeks to deny gay people the rights they deserve, as a bigot. Their view is not acceptable.",8,0,Yes
308,"gay marriage","So far, I have never heard a single case of Gay couples creating a genetically malformed child.

THAT is how the two are different.

2,"gay marriage","I don't know what sort of argument you're making. I cannot imagine an argument against gay marriage that is not based (at least in some convoluted fashion) on religion. Please tell me what non-religious objections you see to gay marriage. Seriously.
I don't feel the need to include the westborough baptist church in the debate. There is no way to convince a lot of people, and they if they have no good reason for not analysing their own convictions, then they deserve to be excluded from the debate. I'm not demonising the opposition, I'm demonising that special brand of opposition, that has absolutely constructive argument to make. They are the minority. If you hold up a sign that says "god hates gays", you forfeit your right to be included in the discussion.
It's interesting that you use the example of civil rights. Now in the early days of the movements, the majority was not in favour of civil rights. This does not mean that older generations were not racist. They were, but then times changed, and the racists slowly became the minority, and sanity prevailed. I see this configuration as parallel to the issue of gay rights (not quite so nasty, with the lack of slavery). Eventually, I think gay people will have all of the rights afforded to straights (marriage), and this will be because the majority wants it that way. At that time, the minority, who has no cogent argument as to why gay people do not deserve the rights, will be referred to as bigots, for their unenlightened views.
Before the majority was enlightened about the equality of minorities, they still deserved equal rights, and the majority that withheld them was wrong to do so. It's not like the withholding was right and justified, until the majority opinion shifted. It is and always was wrong. When gay people are considered equal under the law, the same thing will be said about them.
As a separate issue, from what I understand, civil unions are legally identical to marriage. Why then, invent another term? If it's legally the same, call it marriage. Why this need to keep them separate? The more groups are kept different from one another, the more they are the 'other'.
"consent alone" has nothing to do with it. Separate the issue from incest and whatever else. Amend the constitution to make it legal for two consenting people to marry, *regardless of sex*. There are already laws against marrying consanguineous relatives, just don't get rid of those. Removing the "man and woman" qualification will therefore not open the door for incest, or polygamy, or marrying animals or lamps, or whatever the hell some republicans say.

308,"gay marriage","How exactly do you hope to separate the two? In order to seperate the procreation component from the psychological, you would need to deny how nature works at it's base. Our psychology (and therefore idea of morality) works the way it does because of the evolution that went it to forming it. This is incorrect? Do dogs and cat's worry about morality or do they just survive out of instinct? Our morality (i.e. psychology) has formed out of respect to our environment and to give our species a better chance at survival. The only reason incest is a taboo is because of the way we evolved to procreate. I'm sure throughout history, that had we evolved to not need genes somehow, there would be no need for built in psychological barriers against incest. As it stands, nature did evolve this mechanism to protect the health of our species. Nature does not devise moral rules for us to follow, it simply weeds out what doesn't work and especially that which harms. So looking at this issue from a religious based moral point of view is, in my opinion, wrong. It's simple. Humans should not do something that nature SPECIFICALLY guards against, when it obviously has ill consequence's. Well, ill consequences for our offspring. Go ahead and drink or huff YOURSELF to death. We developed psychological barriers to combat incest, and therefore, combat genetic mutation....seeing as gays don't procreate, there is no risk (well, there's still sh*tty luck) of harmful mutation. Even if it was possible for gays to procreate, once again, the genetic material of both.....barring the poss. of gay incest relatives....is sufficiently varied to prevent mutation. So, seeing as it does not harm any offspring, Gay marriage (gay couples period) should not be harassed. It harms nothing inherently, including DNA, and so should be morally acceptable. Crazy/immoral parent's raise crazy/immoral children (well, there's a higher chance). Not all gays are crazy or immoral. Also, nature should always be the basis of morality when it comes to Life and Death issues and Procreation. Religion has no place in either if it attempts to create bias outside of what nature has deemed acceptable. We DO live on Earth after all.....might make sense to follow the rules it uses to go about it's business. It's been doing it's thing far longer than we have. (side note to those reading this without inerest in the actual debate: The last 2 lines may make me look like a hippocrite in the future, but this argument seperate from my little issue.

Besides, what should we do with all the single heterosexual parents and their children? Split them up and give the children to new "complete and correct" families?

912,"gay marriage",""Thats the world we live in. Constantly changing, nothing is constant”
Yes the world is constantly changing. Perhaps you should look a little back further into history.
Marriage has not always been defined as between a man and a women. Sometimes It was between many women and a man. Sometimes it was a result of a business of political deal, Most-times the women was just and object rather than a person. And yes, sometimes (historically) it was between people of the same sex. Religion wasn’t always the basis for marriage, and homosexuals were not always excluded.
Religion did get a bit of a monopoly on it and though there have been good things done via religion, many atrocities have been done as well.
So, what good reason do you have to stop our society from becoming more tolerant? We gave women rights, we gave people of other races rights, etc. If your reason is “because marriage is a thing for strait people and it makes me uneasy” suck it up.

Secondly your argument hold no ground because the existence of your God is debated. We don’t know if actually there is a different God, if there is no God, of if there is your god but he happens to not be loving.
Before you can use this as a valid argument you have to A) Prove that there is a God B) Prove that it is your god and C) explain his reasons for calling homosexuality wrong (Ie. Why is it wicked?).
but to be fair I will address some of your points.
"If God wanted us to be homosexual then He would have made us all asexual.”
- I don’t think you understand what homosexuality is.. Asexual means you have NO sexual attraction.. you only do it with yourself. homosexuality means you do have a sexual attraction, to the same sex
"But that isn't the case so therefore gay marriage should not be allowed.”
- So marriage needs to have the ability to make children? What about strait couples who just adopt? What about people who are infertile, what about elderly couples? what about couples who don’t want kids. To say that homosexuality is wrong because you can’t produce children when there are married heterosexuals who just have sex for pleasure is hypocritical
"What happened in the Bible with Sodom and Gamora, when they were having gay relations?”
- actually according to your bible it was not because of Gay relations, but because of gang rape, and other various wicked deeds. Regardless, this is just a story, I could pick a line from buddhism or islam that suggests your ignorant and following the wrong religion. But until any of us has proof, religious beliefs, though with strong convictions, are just our opinions.
"If God wanted people to be gay then he wouldn't of desroyed Sodom and Gamora”
- The current evidence proves that homosexuality is a natural phenomenon, and there is a considerable amount of evidence that suggests genes play a big role, and further tests are going on to assess the benefits of homosexuality to the whole species (Ie. a natural limiter to population growth so that the resources get pressure taken off them). Keeping in mind the evidence we have two likely options.
A) the bibles stance on homosexuality was actually that of the hebrews (based on their limited understanding of the world and the nature of homosexuality), and they thought it was unnatural so they thought God would disapprove..
Look at leveiticus where it says homosexuality is bad, it also says children who curse should be stoned to death, Shellfish are an abomination just like homosexuality, if you have sex with your wife on her period you and she are automatically out-cased from society, and if you have a wet dream you must leave society and do a three day cleaning ritual to be clean again in the eyes of God...

Their lifestyle choices have nothing to do with their personality and the brilliance they can offer just like any other human being. Yes, you're right, nothing is constant. Marriage has always changed. A long time ago many marriages were based on polygamy seeing the women as an object, child bearer, or home maker rather than the person you would like to spend your life with. Marriage at certain periods of time DID include homosexual marriage and was later changed based on religion. Not long ago was it that interracial marriage was allowed. Are you against that too?
Society is constantly in a state of change and whether you like it or not homosexuals will always be there not only in humans but in the many other species of animals. Letting them marry may affect your religious views on marriage, but in this country marriage is not based on your religion. Politics in this country are based on equality and basic human rights rather than your religious views. This country was formed based on separation and state, and it was formed based on that principle for a very good reason. Religion was corrupting society. Your religion should not be pushed onto others, not everybody believes in your religion. In this country there are 2 different kinds of marriage a court recognized marriage which is recognized by the state and a religious marriage which allows your marriage to be recognized by your religion. These are 2 very separate things, if marriage was still based on religion you wouldn't be able to waltz into a court house and get your marriage done there and then.
Many things you do on probably a daily basis go against your religion. Do you eat pork, drink alcohol, use profanity, or talk back to your parents? All of these are against Christianity. If your religion allows you to find enlightenment with yourself, then I am all for it! That changes when those ideals are brought into politics; religion and politics are called two different things for a reason and should remain that way. Please don't start the argument of people pushing gay marriage on you when we ask you not to push your religion unto others.

Religion is a choice, while being homosexual is not, and everybody's allowed to worship their religion, while homosexuals aren't alound to worship their body's own desires.

308,"gay marriage","Actually: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances. This language is used to SPECIFY what it is and is not permissible for the government to form legislation on, and then force on the population. If people form legislation based on religious views, even though it may not be a formal establishment of religious law, it still IS AN ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGIOUS LAW. If this country were primarily Muslim and they were attempting to legislate that all women must wear burkas, "BECAUSE IT'S MODEST", not because the Koran states it's necessary, you would still fight it and force them to acknowledge it as an attempt at religious law. The same applies here. It's an attempt by many to force their religious beliefs in legislation by disguising it as just a personal belief and decision. There is absolutely no twisting of words there. (This last bit is for the post above yours) Even if it is a personal decision without religious basis/bias, you then have to argue against all the secular evidence in support of gay marriage, same sex child-rearing, etc. Professional psychologists of all backgrounds have largely supported it. Also to the claim that it's necessary to have two parents to be productive in society, I call bullsh*t. I have met plenty of people with a single parent who were well-balanced and productive, while I've met an equally large number of people who had 2 parents, and yet, were complete scum. The quality of the parents matters far more than the quantity. Any attempt to argue otherwise ignores clear examples: Hitler, Mussolini, Dahmer, and many other monsters had two parents. Both J.K Rowling, and Ruth Bader Ginsberg (a supreme court-justice) are single mothers. Sonia Sotomayor, Oprah Winfrey, and Michael Phelps are all single children. Oprah Winfrey and Michael Phelps have both proven extremely strong willed and psychologically sound (I don't know much about Sotomayer but I thinks it safe to say her career has had it's challenges). Again, I also like to argue that since proper child-rearing requires two parents, what are we to do about all current single parents? What do we do about the children of deceased Iraq/Afghan vets? What do we do about to save the children who are being successfully raised by single parents throughout the country without welfare, without having to work two jobs, without having to miss bonding time?

1- group marriage isnt exactly something new. Sure, it may be that in the west this wasn't practiced, but you can't say that a man has never had a bastard child. that alone proves that people are not monogamous by nature, and so it isnt strange, or weird. In some societes men could take multiple wives.
2- That is to say, that a mother and a father present are required for a child to grow up healthy and happy. So, you then indirectly state that every child that had a mother and father developed adecuately? You realize you then exclude single mothers and fathers, and blame their childrens shortcomings as adults on the fact that someone else was not there. and what of children who had both mother and father but grew up to be serial killers? you generalize on the idea that "mommy and Daddy"make a childs life perfect when in reality even the best mother and father can have a child that is say.. mentally challenged. What of his mental development? is it proper?
3 now, if you say you want to keep state and church seperate, wouldnt thinking of the religious mans feelings be doing just the oppisite? and saying religion keeps the uneducated controlled, are you not acting the same way that the modern church acts as an institution, regarding individuality as negative? that may not be a religious argument per say but it is afected by the church, and you should rethink what you typed. Now even if you have a point about the average person and their religious beliefs keeping them from commiting crimes, crimes happen regardless of religion so I cant say bending over backwards to please them helps any way at all.

"i oppose any gay lovers who wants to adopt a child. i firmly believe a child need both a father and mother for proper mental development .. " Straight people are single parents all the time.

"allowing gay marriages will hurt religious minded people .. although i am an atheist i believe religion is needed for those who are uneducated .. it is only religion that keeps the average person from stealing even in great distress. religion keeps the masses of people in check .. anything to weaken their believe will not end well."
