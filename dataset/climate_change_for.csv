485;"climate change";"the earth's TEMPERATURE changes, but the CLIMATE is getting hotter and hotter.. If youve ever heard of the ozone, it protects the earth from harmful UV rays from the sun. When there is not ozone, UV rays will enter the earth's atmosphere and make it hotter here. After the nuclear war (WWIII -- It is inevitable) the ozone will be blown to bits and wont exist anymore.. therefore whatever is left of the human race wont be able to walk the earth for another 10 years or so till it rebulds itself..";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"

1339;"climate change";"thomasa93: This debate is about whether or not global warming is real. It does not ask whether you believe it is caused by human activity. Since you acknowledge that earth temperatures do in fact fluctuate, are you conceding the reality of global warming, though you may not believe it is caused by our actions?";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
689;"climate change";"Yesterday (Feb 2nd) was the first big snowstorm here in Worcester, MA New England... and we are only going to have prolly less than a month of 'real winter' here...";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
755;"climate change";"I believe in global warming. People may not notice it, but right now there are many species of animals that are going extinct. For instance, the polar bears, their behaviors have changed because of this. Many animals in the frozen lands are having strange behaviors because of GW. They are waking up earlier today from hibernation unlike in the past years.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
755;"climate change";"Yes, it is true that the temperature of the earth have increased since those years. Now ask yourself this question: Was there pollution during those years? Yes we can say that the temperature of the earth is increasing. Today, it is still increasing but abnormally. This is caused by gases that accumulates in the atmosphere and traps the heat which causes global warming. A thousand years ago, the ice melted for about a hundred plus years or so. Now, the polar regions can melt in more or less 25 years.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
895;"climate change";"Yes, the atmospheric processes are complex and hard to predict, yes there have been fluctuations of temperature before in history. Particulary the medieval warming period, is a very interesting piece that don't fit any end-all easy explanation. The concept known as Global Warming imply that there will be some kind of trouble (the exact numbers are contested, but higher temperatures are a prime concern). It is also included in this theory that it is caused by human activities. The reason I'm concerned, is the fact that we've changed the composition of the atmosphere far outside of the natural parameters. CO2 levels are approaching 33% more than previous recorded high points ever before in physical evidence in the nature. (that's about 400.000 years back). About half of this artificial increase have happened since 1945, and correlates VERY STRONGLY to industrial activity of human civilization. Note, this is the CO2-levels only. This is LARGE SCALE terraforming, and the one thing everybody is agreeing on is that we don't know enough about this to say exactly where we're heading. That is like going way too fast by car, with 10 meters of visibility. Even if we find we're not going were we want, we'll be in deep trouble because we're going too fast. If this were traffic, and not terraforming, this would be considered irresponsible. Considering the measured CO2 levels, and even the weakest positive correlation to temperature, global warming is an undenieable fact. Now add in the recent change in weather (during the time-span of only the last 100 years), estimated past/future CO2 levels, and the accelerating emissions of other 'climate' gases from an ever heavier industrialized world economy, i feel pretty confident that the lowest estimates of climate change is already going to happen, and that medium-to-bad scenario are a distinct possibility.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
1959;"climate change";"Scientists' models of 'normal' factors of global warming and cooling, such as sun activity, volcanic activity and other natural factors line up almost exactly with the actual temperature record. Now, in the last half century, there is a sudden spike that is unexplained by these natural activities. This spike directly correlates with human-caused factors that some scientists long predicted might cause global warming. After more research, the large majority of scientists have concluded that humans are largely responsible for this most recent spike. The evidence for this has gotten better over the years, especially over the last 2 or 3.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
478;"climate change";"The Earth does go through phase changes. Remember in the 80's when the scientists said that we are supposed to be in an Ice Age? Well we are supposed to be. We are well overdue for one. Our Earth is heating up and it is blocking the Ice Age. Now if you say well that's good then you are mistaken. When our children's children's children's... children come to the point where the "Ice Age" has stopped the effects of Global Warming will be phenominal.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
478;"climate change";"Michael Savage is an idiot. He is deeply depressed and I remeber him saying on time "Why should we have a depressed leader. Who wants a depressed leader". Now why would he expect us to follow him then. So he is expecting things that he disagrees with himself. He is a two-face.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"

1952;"climate change";"Can you legitimately say WHY it's a hoax? Have you any evidence to back up your claim that the overwhelming majority of environmental scientists have been fooled?";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
1952;"climate change";"How is it evidence against global warming? You are assuming that the ozone hole is merely the result of temperature, and not other influences (CFCs/HFCs). 1979 was about the beginning of the period when the ozone layer became a serious scientific issue that began garnering public support.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
1952;"climate change";"1) Of course. He was incorrect to use the ozone hole as evidence FOR global warming, but you are equally incorrect to use it as evidence AGAINST. CFCs are a powerful greenhouse gas - but they are found in so miniscule a scale (in comparison to CO2, CH4) that they don't really have any part in global warming, so apart from some localized side-effects, the ozone layer plays a minor role in the whole scheme of things (unless, of course, you're talking about upper-atmospheric cooling CAUSED by the ozone hole - a different matter entirely) 2) The increased size of the ozone hole causing localized cooling over Antarctica is due to the above phenomenon. During the ozone-oxygen cycle which creates and ozone layer and makes it so crucial to life, UV light is turned into heat via this cycle. The lack of ozone (destroyed by CFC/HFCs) means that this cycle can no longer proceed on the same scale as before, which means less heat being produced.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"
1952;"climate change";"1. If it has ever warmed at this speed before, please, point out the evidence for those less enlightened. 2. Impossible to predict?! How do weather forecasts work? Go look up some of the work of the Hadley Centre - they can't predict ACCURATELY what is going to happen, but they can get a general, big idea, which is what is important. 3. And how is the Kyoto Protocol evidence for/against GW? While I won't dispute it's uselessness and it's pathetic compromises, I don't think it's relevant here. 4. Source? Michael Crichton doesn't count. The variation in the models, by the way, stem as much from OUR possible response (which is by far the most unpredictable variable in this whole debate) as it does from logical workings. 5. Now... you say a lot about global dimming, but I don't think you really understand it. The reason all the fuss about global dimming... dimmed after 1970 is because of the introduction of various Clean Air Acts around the world, which halted the pumping of various sulfur monoxides, dioxides and so on which act as global DIMMERS - they reflect sunlight very well, but can't trap it at all. They are quite short-lived, though, so remove the source of the SO's and you remove the problem. This was, however, associated with a sudden jump in global temperatures as the global dimmers, which were holding back GW, were removed - the 'magic gate' years. That isn't to say they still don't have an effect to some degree - following 9/11 (and the grounding of all planes in the US), scientists noticed a avg. 1C rise in temperature across the country, as the jet contrails (which were acting as dimmers) cleared off due to there being no planes in the sky. (source: 'The Weather Makers') 6. Try giving me what they said in 2006. A lot can change (ESPECIALLY in computers) in 5 years.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"

127;"climate change";"I believe that global warming is happening, but I do not necessarily believe that humans are all to blame for it. Partly yes. But scientists stated that the volcano Krakatoa released more carbon dioxide into the air than 100 years of motor cars all over the ENTIRE world. Which is a lot. But yeah, I think that global warming is imminent. it's the natural course of this earth. And there's not much we can do to stop it.";4;0;2;"Yes, I beleive in Global Warming"

1348;"climate change";"Every last scientist. Every last one agrees that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes an increase in global temperatures. You will not find one paper published which does not agree with this. And the fact is undeniable that humans are pumping a huge amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Global temperature systems are more out of whack than they have ever been save in "cataclysmic events." And we, as macroscopic life, had better hope that we don't cause one of those.";4;0;2;Fact

1603;"climate change";"Although Global Warming as a concept is not entirely new, I have to admit that our role in this world as a pollutor of our atmosphere plays an inevitably big role and we too are to blame. the extent to which, however, is to this day still a controversial debate amongst many scientists as well as people like ourselves. But we must face up to the consequences of our own actions by admitting that this is partially our fault, only then can we move forward in trying to solve this problem to the extent we are humanly able to.";4;0;2;yes
1341;"climate change";"Actually, there are some quite reliable figures regarding the temperature fluctuaions that the Earth undergoes every few thousand years and to date, there has been no evidence to suggest that natural warming has ever occured to this kind of scale before the industrial revolution. Much of the evidence for human global warming stem from logic. For example, if one were to set fire to a small pinch of gun powder and observe its reaction, one could predict what would happen if one set fire to a whole keg of it. An explosion, only larger in magnatude. It's the same concept with global warming. CO2 is a known greenhouse gas that increases temperatures, releasing large amounts of it will not simply have no impact on the planet. Especially since humans are destroying the largest storages of Carbon on the planet, the Rainforests of the Amazon. Of course, don't just take my word for it. Take the words of 2,500 top scientists from 130 nations: http://ca.today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyid=2007-02-02T211359Z_01_L01923284_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-GLOBALWARMING-WRAP-COL.XML&src=rss";4;0;2;yes
2121;"climate change";"I agree with the scientists. It's just too much of a coincidence that the logic behind human induced global warming (Greenhouse effect etc) and the fact that the earth IS indeed warming up and has risen dramatically since the industrial revolution. The earth's temperature may have risen naturally but we have certainly played a large role in this. But we shouldn't forget the irrevocable damage that cows have caused through the natural excretion of methane gases!";4;0;2;yes
1603;"climate change";"We have to tackle the problem from two sides here. Whether or not you agree that we play a part in global warming, you cannot deny the fact that our CO2 emissions are not the primary reason for things such as Acid Rain which also contributes in the decay of many historical and cultural buildings, as well as nature itself. You're stating that apart from nuclear power, Hydrogen Powerplants and Windmills would be ineffective? It leads me to believe you haven't thought this through very well. If, whatever country we are talking about, decides to adapt an approach whereby the entire country were to be powered by renewable resources, the following would happen: 1. Oil / Coal / Gas consumption would decrease enormously. 2. The money previously spent on purchasing the fossile fuels required to generate electricity can be used to build and expand on facilities that create renewable resources. 3. It would provide huge employment opportunities and economical benefit. 4. Any excess electricity that is generated could be sold to countries abroad (as is done now) but because the generation of renewable energy costs next to nothing, this electricity could be sold for 70% of the amount it would cost to generate or pucrhase this electricity otherwise. 5. Profits obtained from selling energy to foreign countries could be used to invest in re-forestation programmes to help cut down the presence of CO2 in our atmosphere. Result: Problem Solved. Why aren't we doing this? 1. The Oil tycoons won't be happy 2. There is no political will to get this done 3. Governments never stamp out long-term policies and never make a significant move, backing, or investment into anything new - they always take little steps, little, and slowly, which sometimes, isn't good enough. Additionally: 1. We would combat problems of Acid rain 2. We would at least prevent the problem from getting worse. 3. A noteworthy investment into this approach would lead to a noteworthy result.";4;0;2;yes
414;"climate change";"Face it, we are the bacteria of this age. As in ages past, when CO2 emissions warmed the planet up enough, it triggered the planets natural response. Ice Age. In the past, other organisms were responsible for the CO2 buildup. Now, we are. Let's face it, we are pouring chemicals into the air that effect the atmosphere. Every action has a reaction. That being said, there isn't much we can do about it. It isn't economically feasible at present to do anything about it. You'll never get China and India on board to forego their 100 years of rapid growth.";4;0;2;yes
967;"climate change";"of course it's Man's fault. everything is. just ask any Woman.";4;0;2;yes
1606;"climate change";"What do you mean by cloud? The greenhouse gases do not create a cloud but are mixed into the atmosphere where they stayed until they are scrubbed by some active process. The reason for the reduction of carbon in the atmosphere is from a couple major processes. One of which is life. Life is carbon based and will remove carbon from the environment. In the Carboniferous there was mass burials of life which stored the carbon as coal. The other process started about 50 million years ago. There was mass uplifting (until the the Earth was a lot more flat then it is now). This resulted in increased weathering and a common weathering process scrubs carbon from the atmosphere. By burning all the fossil fuels we will be restoring large amounts of carbon back into the atmosphere, resulting is atmospheric composition not seen for 50 million years. This does not just settle out and will not go away in any timespan relevant to our civilization.";4;0;2;yes
1606;"climate change";"One, how many of these scientists are actual climatologists and other related subjects? How many of these individuals still hold the same view? I read the link and the information given made me even more doubtful of your claim.";4;0;2;yes
1341;"climate change";"Logic DOES apply to the Earth's climate system. Obviously, there is a mechanism that ensures that the mean temperature one year will not be 125 degrees celsius and -45 degrees the next. There is a certain set of ranges in which temperature fluctuates. Human activity is changing those ranges, raising them as it were. Even if we cannot predict just how much temperatures will change, it does not mean our assesments are invalid. For example, if you didn't study for a test and you know you did poorly, you won't know EXACTLY how poorly but that doesn't mean that you still didn't screw up your test. Saying that it's impossible to predict future climate accurately is irrelivant, just because we can't say PRECICELY how much the globe will warm, doesn't mean it won't.";4;0;2;yes
209;"climate change";"Watch "an inconvinent truth, a whole movie of proff! and yes its all true.";4;0;2;yes
147;"climate change";"First of all, I want to say a couple of the arguments above are extremely sad. You're the kind of "bad environmentalist" I don't like very much. An Inconvenient Truth is filled with more than a few mis-truths. a lot of that movie was just plain bad acting and he never once explains who "top scientists" are, where they are, and where they get all of their conclusive data. You can't say "top scientists" in any argument as if YOUR scientists are better than THEIR scientists, because that's just self-righteous crap. The measure of evidence collected so far by many scientists is that we have 'something' to do with recent global warming. I can accept this. The real argument right now is "to what extent is man responsible?" This may not be as measurable as some scientists would claim, and it may be more measurable than other scientists claim. For me, having 'something' to do with global warming is enough reason to make drastic changes right effing now. Err on the side of caution. Saying, "we can't measure Man's true effect on global warming" basically says to me, man is affecting global warming. Let's do what we can to reverse the trend.";4;0;2;yes
732;"climate change";"We take unimaginable amounts of oil and coal from under the ground, and spread it into the sky. That is bound to cause problems.";4;0;2;yes
1455;"climate change";"the truth is that the world is overpopulated by people. Many other species in nature have over used their habitat and have caused harm to the future generations of their kind. If there is any certain species to blame for global warming then it is obviously human. I've never seen any other animal drive a car or build a factory.";4;0;2;yes
2139;"climate change";"Although the movie itself does not cite sources, It is inevitably obvious that warming has INCREASED after the age of industrialization (1920 - Present). How can you go around ignoring this?";4;0;2;yes
2139;"climate change";"Please if you provide a link you would have me convinced.";4;0;2;yes
2319;"climate change";"I'm not quite sure I understand. In order to prove that humans are not responsible for global warming, you argue that we cannot predict to what degree humans have caused global warming, and that even if we were to take action to prevent global warming it wouldn't do much good. However, it seems to me that at the point you admit that reducing CO2 and other similar emissions would have an effect (however small) on reducing global warming, and agree further that humans are responsible for these emissions, you aren't actually disagreeing with the fact that humans are responsible for global warming, just telling us that it could be worse. Also, though it is true that the earth is dynamic, it seems a bit suspicious that the latest rise in temperatures - and it is quite a large one - took place just as humans began to industrialize. Since the earth has had maybe two or three cycles of heating/cooling in the past forty thousand years, what are the odds that a rise in temperatures would occur exactly at this time? Moreover, even if we agree that the rise in global temperatures is somehow part of a natural cycle, the fact that the earth is warming itself does not in any way disprove the fact that we are warming it as well. Just because the earth warms naturally doesn't mean that no other warming can occur, and it is rather difficult to argue that gases which naturally trap warm air under them don't actually warm the planet unless you don't believe in the basic laws of physics. The argument that humans are responsible for global warming presumes nothing else than that adding more gases in the atmosphere keep mores heat inside, something that has been proven time and time again in a laboratory and really should not be very controversial.";4;0;2;yes

2318;"climate change";"There is little need to argue. There is a scientific consensus. The few anti-anthropogenic global warming "experts" out there appear to me to be sell-outs and/or frauds. After hearing the anti-anthropogenic global warming position about a zillion times from a wingnut friend of mine (I was once one myself and still count many as friends), I decided as a good philosopher, to really put it to the test. Try to really find out.... So, I searched a variety of websites for information against global warming and found a right-wing "think tank" that had a list of something like 400 top experts who supposedly had written papers proving that any warming we might be experiencing has nothing to do with humans. I decided to write their experts, many of whom were at top universities, to see what they really thought. In each case I had to find their e-mail address myself, so it took many hours just to compile the first 40 or so --- but it was enough to convince me.... Out of the first forty, every single one agreed that global warming is happening and that humans are a cause. All but one said that humans were the main cause. All but one said that the warming represented a serious (maybe even catastrophic) problem. Several of them commented on the fact that there was a scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming exists. My conclusion... the think tank was lying through its teeth. Interestingly, a few of the scientists tried to figure out how their research could have been so completely mischaracterized. In each case they figured that the compilers had used some of their 10-20 year old papers from back in the heyday of research on solar cycles. That research suggested solar cycles were responsible for many hot and cold periods in the past. But that research, though still considered good, cannot and does not account for current warming trends... trends which only anthropogenic models account for. These and many other researchers I wrote called the use of their research by the think tank a fraud. More than one mentioned the repeated abuse of their research and one even said he had an ongoing lawsuit with an oil company over the fraudulent misrepresentation of his research. It took me a little time and effort, but in the end it became clear to me that there is no significant doubt in the scientific community that anthropogenic global warming is a real threat.";4;0;2;yes
2325;"climate change";"I would say that man has played a vital role in contributing to the process of global warming. Of course the fact that there are a few natural factors that also promote to this should not be denied. If we take the contribution to global warming by these two sources as a percentage. 95% would be by human beings. ever since the industrial revolution took place during the 18th century in Britain and the world moving towards Globalization the emission of green house gasses has increased rapidly and due to industrialization the amount of Co2 that is emitted in to the atmosphere increases. Also due to the increasing population deforestation takes place and large areas of forests are just being cleared away. When deforestation takes place there arnt any trees to absorb CO2 and this co2 fills the atmosphere and promotes to the depletion of the ozone layer as well. when this happens the earth is able to absorb more UV rays.

The total amount of gas released during non-eruptive periods from the beginning of July to the end of October was 9.1X10^8 kg . I do not have an estimate for the volume of CO2 released during the Plinian eruptions. As a long-term average, volcanism produces about 5X10^11 kg of CO2 per year, that production, along with oceanic and terrestrial biomass cycling maintained a carbon dioxide reservoir in the atmosphere of about 2.2X10^15 kg. Current fossil fuel and land use practices now introduce about a (net) 17.6X10^12 kg of CO2 into the atmosphere and has resulted in a progressively increasing atmospheric reservoir of 2.69X10^15 kg of CO2. Hence, volcanism produces about 3% of the total CO2 with the other 97% coming from man-made sources. For more detail, see Morse and Mackenzie, 1990, Geochemistry of Sedimentary Carbonates.

After hearing the anti-anthropogenic global warming position about a zillion times from a wingnut friend of mine (I was once one myself and still count many as friends), I decided as a good philosopher, to really put it to the test. Try to really find out.... So, I searched a variety of websites for information against global warming and found a right-wing "think tank" that had a list of something like 400 top experts who supposedly had written papers proving that any warming we might be experiencing has nothing to do with humans. I decided to write their experts, many of whom were at top universities, to see what they really thought. In each case I had to find their e-mail address myself, so it took many hours just to compile the first 40 or so --- but it was enough to convince me.... Out of the first forty, every single one agreed that global warming is happening and that humans are a cause. All but one said that humans were the main cause. All but one said that the warming represented a serious (maybe even catastrophic) problem. Several of them commented on the fact that there was a scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming exists. My conclusion... the think tank was lying through its teeth. Interestingly, a few of the scientists tried to figure out how their research could have been so completely mischaracterized. In each case they figured that the compilers had used some of their 10-20 year old papers from back in the heyday of research on solar cycles. That research suggested solar cycles were responsible for many hot and cold periods in the past. But that research, though still considered good, cannot and does not account for current warming trends... trends which only anthropogenic models account for. These and many other researchers I wrote called the use of their research by the think tank a fraud. More than one mentioned the repeated abuse of their research and one even said he had an ongoing lawsuit with an oil company over the fraudulent misrepresentation of his research. It took me a little time and effort, but in the end it became clear to me that there is no significant doubt in the scientific community that anthropogenic global warming is a real threat.";4;1;2;"Man's CO2 output"

They started complaining that the world's temperatures are rapidly decreasing and the world will enter an Ice Age. Well because of this industries were forced to put platinum filters on exhaust pipes in factories and automobiles. The air has been tested and has come back cleaner than it was back in the 60's and 70's. Wait! The air is cleaner?

Umm so far there hasn't been any decrease in the abundancy of photoplankton. Biology! Photosynthesis, in its "basic form" uses sunlight, energy, to convert CO2, the "greenhouse gas", into oxygen and water. This is how plants feed and how Photoplankton feed.

Certainly not warmer than the Jurassic period which had 4 to 5 times more CO2. Maybe T-rex owned massive industrial complexes? Always very convenient that tempurature charts always start from the 1600's, during the height of the little ice age to make the climb look more shocking. And why was it so cold during the little ice age? Could it have to do with, well, don't mention it, but the Sun. That giant ball of gas that provides the earth with its temperature? Nah. Could it be that during the Maunder Minimum in the 17th Century there were hardly any sunspots at all? No way. (dripping with sarcasm btw). It's probably that whole green house gas. Not the giant ball of nuclear fusion. Since our study of temperature and nature have been so recent, to me, it's not worth the risk to make industry spend trillions of dollars, and restrict our freedom in an attempt to make the world colder.

Where's YOUR credibility? Are YOU an expert? Your little shpiel about CO2 output and intake doesn't hold a lot of ground, you have yet to prove causality which is KEY in proving your theory. Pro-AGW dodges the question of why when temperature raises, CO2 raises years later, rather than the other way around as Al Gore would like you to believe. Lets not forget the fact that so far most of the facts you have Asserting its 90% plausible that humans are responsible for the majority of recent climate change is a big thing to say. You made the statement but haven't actually proven yourself... where's your evidence? I'll remind you that "most of the scientific community says so" will not cut it. As Bob Carter stated, science isn't about consensus (its about testing a hypothesis, but thats not important). "All it proves is that one side was better prepared than the other. " So a panel of scientists couldn't better prepare for a debate that they spend most of their time researching? "Now you have credible evidence provided by Scientists. Your claims hold no water. " Tell me what evidence that was provided was not true. I'll wait for your responce. You claim that my sources are biased and yet Bob Carter asserts the fact that he is an agnostic when it comes to the belief of AGW, and fyi the majority of the scientific community that searches to prove AGW are guilty of confirmative bias. Asking questions such as "why has the global temperature not risen for 10 years even though CO2 has risen 4%" is biased? Not only this, but only empirical data was supplied in Bob Carter's speech. No computerized projections like most AGW'ers use to make their estimates. Solid. Empirical. Data.

Hate to come in this very late and make 'big' satements, but being a scientist, I think it is essential that I make a few comments. 1. What exactly do you mean by 'scientist'? Would you wish a geologist, who studies crystaline structures of rocks, to be the main authority on all cancer studies? What about a scientist who studies pesticides designin the next space shuttle's rocket boosters? Or how about the field of fluid dynamics being dominated by a geneticist? How about an epidemiologist evaluating high-energy particles? The fact is, the term 'scientist' describes a whole class of professionals with very different fields of study, many of each not only do not overlap, they do not even touch. What is common to all scientists is not the information they study, but the methodology and analysis they apply to their field of expertise. In other words, physicists don't take biology courses and vice versa.... If you want to know about the Earth's climate, consulting 'a scientist' is not enough. You need to consult a scientist that actually studied the Earth's climate....and I am prepared to back up with evidence that the VAST majority of scientists who have actually studied the Earth's climate - in any way, shape or form - support the assertion that while the climate is changing, these changes are NOT anthropogenic. However, there are people on this site who HAVE made definite statements as to the scientific consensus on this topic.... OK - PROVE IT!

That just happens to be my 'specialization'... If you have read the IPCC's report, then you are aware of the study from which the methodology for normalizing the surface temperature readings was used. There was a controversy, because the 'surface readings', as normalized by the methodology based on this study, were in direct opposition to other data-gathering methods...but ended up being accepted and forming the basis of the IPCC's 2007 report.

After hearing the anti-anthropogenic global warming position about a zillion times from a wingnut friend of mine (I was once one myself and still count many as friends), I decided as a good philosopher, to really put it to the test. Try to really find out.... So, I searched a variety of websites for information against global warming and found a right-wing "think tank" that had a list of something like 400 top experts who supposedly had written papers proving that any warming we might be experiencing has nothing to do with humans. I decided to write their experts, many of whom were at top universities, to see what they really thought. In each case I had to find their e-mail address myself, so it took many hours just to compile the first 40 or so --- but it was enough to convince me.... Out of the first forty, every single one agreed that global warming is happening and that humans are a cause. All but one said that humans were the main cause. All but one said that the warming represented a serious (maybe even catastrophic) problem. Several of them commented on the fact that there was a scientific consensus that anthropogenic global warming exists. My conclusion... the think tank was lying through its teeth. Interestingly, a few of the scientists tried to figure out how their research could have been so completely mischaracterized. In each case they figured that the compilers had used some of their 10-20 year old papers from back in the heyday of research on solar cycles. That research suggested solar cycles were responsible for many hot and cold periods in the past. But that research, though still considered good, cannot and does not account for current warming trends... trends which only anthropogenic models account for. These and many other researchers I wrote called the use of their research by the think tank a fraud. More than one mentioned the repeated abuse of their research and one even said he had an ongoing lawsuit with an oil company over the fraudulent misrepresentation of his research. It took me a little time and effort, but in the end it became clear to me that there is no significant doubt in the scientific community that anthropogenic global warming is a real threat.";4;0;2;Yes

And humans are upsetting the balance of CO2 in the atmosphere. The amount of gas we emit seems minimal when compared to the amount oceans and vegetation emit. However, the CO2 that nature emits (from the ocean and vegetation) is balanced by natural absorptions (again by the ocean and vegetation). We do not absorb what we release, therefore the amount of gas we emit is huge in comparison to nature. Evidence that humans release more CO2 then we absorb compared to nature can be seen here: http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/Carbon_Cycle.gif http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/co2_vs_emissions.gif The effects of stopping airplane use for a small amount of time would not be expected to be seen. There is a difference between climate and weather, what the temperatures were like for the months, days, or weeks following 9-11 were weather, not climate. Climate is something that is seen over a long period of time, at least a few years. Since airplane usage only decreased for a few days and weeks after 9-11, you can not expect to see a large change in CLIMATE, and weather is far to unpredictable to expect to see a change.

However, solar activity leveled off after 1940 and the net influence from sun and volcano since 1940 has been slight cooling. Meaning that the sun and volcanoes should have caused us to, if anything, cool down a bit after 1940, and we did indeed begin to cool until 1970. In 1970, sun and volcano activity remained minimal, but the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere grew ten-fold due to human pollution.

Last summer alone, the melt-off in the Arctic was equal to the size of Alaska, Texas, and the state of Washington combined—a shrinkage that was not predicted to happen until 2040. The loss of Arctic sea ice has resulted in a shorter hunting season for the bears, which has led to a scientifically documented decline in the best-studied population, Western Hudson Bay, and predictions of decline in the second best-studied population, the Southern Beaufort Sea. Both populations are considered representative of what will likely occur in other polar bear populations should these warming trends continue. The Western Hudson Bay population has dropped by 22% since 1987. The Southern Beaufort Sea bears are showing the same signs of stress the Western Hudson Bay bears did before they crashed, including smaller adults and fewer yearling bears. At the most recent meeting of the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (Copenhagen, 2009), scientists reported that of the 19 subpopulations of polar bears, eight are declining, three are stable, one is increasing, and seven have insufficient data on which to base a decision.

From heavy research scientists have found that this because polar bears rely on ice to hunt--as I stated before the chance of a polar bear catching a seal is less then 2% without ice.

Don't take the extinction of any type of animal lightly, diversity is something highly valued in wildlife, without it a single disease could wipe out an entire ecosystem. Ice is decreasing in most areas, except in an area in Antarctica because of a situation specific to it. And it isn't growing in depth. I did research on a glacier on mount baker in Washington this summer. I did a plant study, finding and identifying heather that had just started to grow on exposed rock about a hundred feet above the glacier. Heather takes 40 years to grow after a glacier recedes from the area. So that means, 40 years ago, the glacier was on that exposed rock. And now, the glacier is one hundred feet below it. That means the glacier has not only receded a large amount since the 70's, it's also thinned incredibly.

The world warming can potentially send Europre into an ice age, but this doesn't cause the rest of the world to go into an ice age, nor do we have any proof or documentation that Europe actually does, just probably speculation that it could. The reason why the climate changes every 100'000 thousand years, is because of changes in the Earth's orbital pattern. There are three main orbital cycles, changes in these cycles cause long term changes in when the sun hits the earth during different seasons. For example, 18'000 years ago this cycle caused an increase in the amount of sunlight hitting the Southern Hemisphere and thusly sea ice in Antartica retreated and glaciers in the Southern Hemisphere melted. As ice melts, the ocean loses reflectivity, this decrease in Albedo causes the oceans to absorb much more heat from sun rays, warming them even more, causing more ice to be lost, etc. As the southern ocean warms, this also causes solubility of CO2 in the oceans to decrease, and thusly creates a CO2 feedback, the CO2 released warms the earth more through the green house effect. As the earth warms from this C02 being released, it releases more C02, and other oceans and land areas also lose Albedo. In normal climate change or interglacial periods, C02 amplifies the warming, but orbital cycles initiate the warming. In this climate change, we are initiating the warming with C02 release. Therefore, yes, previous climate changes have been caused by milankovich cycles, but this one is caused by nothing either then humans. Initiating climate change with C02, which normally simply amplifies the warming, could have devastating effects, causing an incredibly sudden change, which would in turn destabilize all animal species, including humans.";4;0;2;"It is more likely that global warming is caused by humans then a natural cause"

4530;"climate change";"Global warming is a bad term. Climate change is the better scientific word to use. Climate change is both man made and a natural process. We know enough from ice cores and fossils that carbon levels have fluctuated all throughout history causing ups and downs in temperature. There are also natural greenhouse gases in our atmosphere (including carbon) that are supposed to be there. The problem is that due to the industrial revolution we have been adding more greenhouse gases to what is supposed to naturally be there. It's not as bad as some will make it out to be, but increased gases will increase temperatures which will melt the ice caps which will affect the salt content of ocean water which will affect ocean currents which will affect land climates. That's something we need to avoid by not adding more greenhouse gases to those which are supposed to be there,";4;0;2;Yes
549;"climate change";"Global warming is not man-made in the sense that man 'made' global warming. However, global warming is a result of the things that men do.

Something as serious as this shouldn't be made into a scam and it shouldn't be treated as a joke either.";4;0;2;Yes
4530;"climate change";"Global warming is not a scam, it's simple science. Greenhouse gases trap radiation the Earth gives off. If we add more greenhouse gases, we trap in more radiation which means temperatures go up. Also, the cap and trade system has reduced SO2 emissions cutting down the amount of acid rain in the northeast that carries over from the midland states. Please don't tell me acid rain is a scam too.";4;0;2;Yes
4482;"climate change";"Dude, stop this obvious troll. The gases don't work as you think they work. They ABSORB heat - they don't reflect heat or whatever you think they do. It's not some sort of a layer that heat can't penetrate - "trap" is misleading in describing the process. From this, as long as you aren't stupid yourself, you will understand how accumulation of greenhouses gases cause rise in temperatures on Earth. This week's debate topic is too one sided, imo. There is basically a ton of science behind human activities having caused (or if you don't want to be too conclusive about that), sped up, global warming. Or you could say it was some amazing sort of coincidence that over the last century greenhouse gases have grown in concentration in the atmosphere (due to humans, no debate there) and at the same time it keeps getter hotter and hotter - Err... just no.";4;0;2;Yes
549;"climate change";"Our atmosphere is meant to let SOME radiation in to warm our planet. Some radiation doesn't enter (they are reflected), the some that does is later released into the atmosphere. The problen is, the radiation that is released gets trapped in the atmosphere. EXCESSIVE Greenhouse gases are responsible for this. Haven't you seen the pictures? Glaciers in the polar caps are slowly melting. The glaciers are slowly decreasing in size that the animals (i.e. polar bears, penguins) are shown to have less space (or ice) to stay on. Besides, it is totally unfair to question the credibility of the scientists. As I've said before, the climate IS changing. It is not just a scam. Who do you think is responsible for the excessive greenhouse gases? Aside from the 'trapped' heat, there is also the case of the hole in our Ozone Layer. Because of the said hole, more heat and UV rays enter our atmosphere. These contribute to the over-all warming of our planet. Do you think the hole is just another part of a scam? There is a hole in the ozone layer because of the CFC gas. CFC is found in hairsprays and other MANMADE products.";4;0;2;Yes

Whatever you say about those gases doesn't erase the fact that humans are the reason for it! As I'v mentioned before, Global warming is the result of the doings of man (i.e. emission of fossil fuel, industrialization, excessive logging, etc.). As many people have observed, the climate is changing. Our planet has been existing perfectly well for the past billion years, that is until men appeared. "Almost all of the evidence shows we are getting warm. There is no doubt about it," said David C. Bader, deputy director of the Oak Ridge Climate Change Science Institute. -- SEE! http://www.wate.com/global/story.asp?s=12855794 The world is getting warmer. You know what?

Some effects of Global Warming include the ff.: 1. Rising sea levels 2. Salt water intrusion 3. Beach erosion 4. Extreme weather 5. Increased rainfall 6. Destabilization of local climates 7. Acidic oceans 8. Drought How else will you explain these phenomenons? By saying that all of it is just part of a scam?!

4530;"climate change";"I got an A- in a college environmental science class so I think I know what I'm talking about. Since you don't let me explain the process. If you picked up a science textbook I wouldn't have to do this. Sun gives off heat in the form of rays which enter our atmosphere. Some of the rays are automatically bounced back into space at the very first layer. The rest enters Earth. Some of the rays automatically bounce off the surface (whether land or water) and leave out atmosphere. Some bounce but due to the layer of greenhouse gases they do not leave our atmosphere and bounce back down which is what I called the "trap". Also, the Earth does produce heat as well and gives off its own radiation which will either leave the atmosphere or be trapped. Greenhouse gases have always been in the Earth's atmosphere since whenever that was billions of years ago. If we didn't have any all the rays we get from the sun would just bounce right back into space. The gases are meant to trap SOME of the rays so the Earth can stay warm. Think of it as a big giant blanket if you will. The problem is that we've been adding more gases than what is naturally supposed to be there. Back to the blanket, imagine you had a nice big comfy blanket that was just the right size and kept you at just the right warmth. Then someone starts making the blanket thicker. It starts to get heavy and you get hot under it and you no longer feel comfortable under it. I know you're a troll and you're just going to post another stupid comment to this but seriously, a five year old could probably understand the blanket concept!";4;0;2;Yes

Lemme tell you.... 1) HYPNOSIS - Inducing a high state of suggestibility, often thinly disguised as relaxation or meditation. 2) PEER GROUP PRESSURE - Suppressing doubt and resistance to new ideas by exploiting the need to belong. 4) REJECTION OF OLD VALUES - Accelerating acceptance of new lifestyle by constantly denouncing former beliefs and values. 5) CONFUSING DOCTRINE - Encouraging blind acceptance and rejection of logic through complex lectures on an incomprehensible doctrine. 6) METACOMMUNICATION - Implanting subliminal messages by stressing certain key words or phrases in long, confusing lectures. 14) CONFESSION - Encouraging the destruction of individual ego through confession of personal weaknesses and innermost feelings of doubt. 15) FINANCIAL COMMITMENT - Achieving increased dependence on the group by 'burning bridges' to the past, through the donation of assets. 16) FINGER POINTING - Creating a false sense of righteousness by pointing to the shortcomings of the outside world. 18) CONTROLLED APPROVAL - Maintaining vulnerability and confusion by alternately rewarding and punishing similar actions. 21) NO QUESTIONS - Accomplishing automatic acceptance of beliefs by discouraging questions. 22) GUILT - Reinforcing the need for 'salvation' by exaggerating the sins of the former lifestyles. 23) FEAR - Maintaining loyalty and obedience to the group by threatening soul, life or limb for the slightest 'negative' thought, word or deed.

But especially on the side which tries to deny global warming at all. Let's ask ourselves a question. Who has got most too lose from manmade global warming. The oil companies paying scientists to perpetuate rumours of global warmings so called flaws, or climatologists who place there whole career on line advocating what is a highly unpopular theory with government and companies, because its repercussions or so great, and would mean both sectors having to spend billions of pounds. It's much easier for people too believe it's not real. The guy on the other side is right to point people in the direction of other alternative theories or so called rebuttals of global warmings 'tax scam myth'. However it fails to miss to important points. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased because of the way we humans make our energy. I consider this to be very simple cause and effect. Also global warming has taken place many times in the past directly correalted to carbon dioxide levels. Also the guy on the other side seems to misunderstand why global warming causes the planet too cool down. It does seem rather parodoxical. This to my understanding is simple. CO2 rises, the more there is the more photons will be blocked from it's passage to the earth, causing the earth to freeze over as the cycle of photosynthesis takes place.

Few people realise that there are roughly 5 billion people alive today (you and me are possibly two of them), that would not be alive, if not for fossil fuels, chiefly oil, as these are used to artificially boost crop yields through being used to produce yield-boosting fertilizers and pesticides (chiefly among these, natural gas is used to synthesize ammonia and urea to provide artificial nitrogen to crops, which probably the biggest yield booster). Not only that, but oil is essentual to lubricate and power farm machinery to sow, maintain and harvest crops, transport the food potentially hundreds of miles to the consumer and process the food. Hence, without fossil fuels, modern agriculture would not function and crop yields would plummet, likely only producing enough for around 2 billion people, hence 5 billion would be "surplus". This means that if our supplies of fossil fuels are ever threatened (and as they are nonrenewable this is inevitable, through peak oil or just from becoming to costly in energy terms to extract), humanity is screwed. If you also consider the exploitation of other nonrenwable resources, the destruction of native habitat such as rainforest which is essentual to our survival and the rapidly rising list of species either extinct or on the brink of extinction, it quickly becomes clear that we are living beyond our means, as through overpopulation, we are unsustainably taxing the Earth. With that said, climate change is simply a sympton of a much larger problem that is our own excesive numbers and if we don't deal with overpopulation soon, mother nature may just do it for us.";4;0;2;Yes
