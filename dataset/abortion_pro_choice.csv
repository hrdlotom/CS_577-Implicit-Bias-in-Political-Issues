There are ways not to get pregnant; there are also exceptions to every rule.

270,abortion,"Those of you who believe that abortion should be outlawed, consider this - In the 70's(I believe, don't hold me to the date), there were thousands of women that got pregnant each year in the US that decided to have an abortion. Since abortion was not legal at this time, many women would go to an illegal clinic where the doctors were untrained. This lead to many women dying from the injection that was meant only to kill the baby. If these women did not choose to have an abortion through one of these illegal clinics, or even sometimes if they did, they would pierce themselves with a wire coat hanger or other things to that effect to kill the baby. Many times this lead to infection and as these women were afraid to tell anyone what they did, they often died instead of getting medical attention. Therefore, in conclusion, many women lost their lives over abortions and, with abortion legal, many lives have been saved. Therefore, the weight of death would (in theory) equal the weight of life. If abortion were outlawed, it would only increase the death and crime rates as illegal clinics were reestablished and pregnant women would become infected from puncture wounds and die.",3,0,Pro-Choice

586,abortion,"The rape scenario actually occurs a lot. About 33% of women in this country have some encounter of being sexually assaulted before the age of 18. Being assaulted once raises the chances you'll get assaulted again later. Assault meaning any form of sexual violence against a woman, not necessarily including sex. So it does occur. The same people, though, that are pro-like are usually against contraceptive drugs. Walmart, for example, didn't (until recently) hand out the abortion pill...so how are women to get their hands on these vital drugs? Abortion pill is also not really technically correct as it doesn't cause abortion just prevents conception. There are quite a few circumstances in which women find themselves in a Christian based hospital after being raped, but they refuse to hand out these emergency measures.
Secondly, its no one else's business!! If you think someone is sinning...its not up to you to judge them. If they really are, God will judge them when their time comes. No one else can do that. We can't presume to know what God thinks of our actions and if we're going to heaven or hell. The Bible, the Torah, the Quran...these are historical books. I believe in the Quran, but you do have to look at it as a historical record of events as well. None of these books should be taken strictly as they are written. They have ALL been edited to suit the audience at the time. For example, some guy in the 12th century, I think, didn't like the version of the angry God as he was being depicted at the time and cut all that stuff out. That is how Christianity comes up with the notion of a loving, merciful, giving God. Editing!

This is also false. Even if one subscribes to the insane belief that something the size of a grain of salt is the moral equivalent of a walking, talking child then there is such a thing as killing in self-defence.

Leave parenting to the responsible and the capable. Give the people who couldn't afford to give a child a good home or the love they need to devop properly a chance to better themselves first. Some people will never want children, but everyone deserves the right to have the time to make their lives habitable for a child.
Some people make mistakes. Other people try to be responsible but something goes wrong. Regardless, it is not the parent you are punishing by forcing them to have a child - never so much as you are punishing the child.

826,abortion,"I am always interested in the beliefs of someone who makes the glib comment of "I choose life". Ok, so what are your parameters? First you need to define life, then define what it means to choose it.
Are we saying that you believe that all life is sacred and nothing should ever be done to cease life? If so, are you a vegetarian? Certainly killing an animal is taking life. Of course so is picking a head of lettuce, so I would guess that even eating veggies is taking life. At the extreme end, bacteria are life forms too, so antibiotics are pretty bad, as is antibac cleaner.
Of course no one actually means that they believe that ALL life is sacred and needs special protection. That was just to illustrate the need to define the problem. So, perhaps the more accurate statement would be, I think all HUMAN life is sacred and should be protected. Tough call to make...doesn't that necessitate that anyone who is pro life is also staunchly anti-war?...as it supports killing.
So, that causes something of a disconnect for those who think that war can even SOMETIMES be justified, if they think abortion should never be. What about those who really are pacifists...they have a better leg to stand on at least.
We still have to define though, when human life begins. What data do you have to back up that the split second between a sperm and an egg existing separately, for a very short period of time, is ok to not preserve and the fertilized egg suddenly becoming mandated to preserve? Guys probably "kill" a lot of sperm over their lives, women "kill" an egg every time they do not make an effort to fertilize it....sperm and egg are both cells. What separates those single cells from the single cell created by their union?
Some are opposed to abortion beyond a certain point. This becomes a much more defensible position, though still a little tough. It is hard to handle the thought of terminating the life of something that looks very close to being human, moreso if that organism has developed to the point where it can actually feel pain.

1836,abortion,"Forcing women to become mothers is a strictly misogynist view. Also, blaming women entirely for the act of bringing a baby into the world is completely backwards. It takes two, and if a woman believes that the man who impregnated her will be irresponsible, or abusive, or resent her for having the baby—why do you expect her to take up all the responsibility for herself? The government does not provide enough help for single mothers and the majority of the country looks down on them as being leeches on the state. Most of the anti-abortion rhetoric revolves around women being irresponsible and messy in their contraception practices, which is sometimes the case, but, like I said, it takes two to conceive. If a man convinces a woman that the pull-out method is safe and that he’ll be careful, she’s not being stupid. She’s being trusting. And sometimes (a lot of times) that doesn’t work out.
Pregnancy is an incredibly expensive, unstable, and physiologically damaging affair. Women should have the option to not put their bodies through it. My own mother was adopted and she remains pro-choice as it is an individual’s decision as to whether or not they want to put their bodies through that.

255,abortion,"1. There is MORE than a 1% chance that a condom and/or birth control fails. Condoms can slip off (for those guys who think they're larger than they are), bust, and tear if the wrong lubricants are used (ky jelly, crisco, anything else with petroleum). And the wrong lubricants are often used, because not everyone has proper education about using condoms, especially not young teens who are now having sex more now than ever. And condoms are the "safest" of all safe sex or birth control methods.
2. The psychological trauma of having to go through a 9 month pregnancy and then A LIFETIME of being a parent (because hello, fathers of unwanted babies are traumatized too) is most definitely going to be more than the psychological trauma of NOT having an UNWANTED child. People feel guilt for aborting children that they don't want, and that's because of the religious and moral values pushed on them from their social environment. They'll get over that much sooner than they would get over being forced to nurture a child they didn't want.
Parents who planned their children often find it much harder to raise children than they originally thought and end up making incredible mistakes that negatively impact their children's lives. How good of a parent can you be if you don't even want the child?
3. The "physical difference" between a child one second before delivery and one second after delivery is that BEFORE delivery, the child is depending on the mother for life and AFTER, the child is an independent being. That's a HUGE difference. If you have a cancerous tumor inside your body, would you want anyone to be able to tell you that you have no right to remove it - even when it could cause your death? If yes, then why does a fetus have more of a right to survive than a cancerous tumor? They're both made up of living cells (sometimes, the tumor is even bigger than a baby before the 3 month cut off period to have an abortion), and they both can cause death or serious health issues in many cases.
4. I just hate when men are anti-choice (yes, anti-choice because pro-choice people are not anti-life), because they won't be the ones who are ultimately affected by a woman's choice to have an abortion. Whether or not the woman has a baby, the father can ditch responsibility and never be heard from again, leaving the woman to raise the baby alone. (And you know how much we all
just LOVE and APPRECIATE single mothers!) Also, it's illegal in some places for a mother to leave her baby somewhere, but they rarely charge the fathers because THEY CAN'T BE FOUND! Negligent fathers who ditched the woman AND the baby 9 months ago are rarely held
accountable. The police go looking for the baby's MOTHER. So if the mother is held more accountable for ditching her baby, then she should also have more say over whether or not to have a baby.

Isn't the mother responsible for putting the future baby's life at risk--or does it only count if there is actually a miscarriage or a stillbirth?
For that matter, shouldn't we be investigating miscarriages and stillbirths more closely? You never know; maybe the mother did something harmful to the pregnancy. If abortion is murder, then that should at least be negligent homicide.

As for the orphanages, improving orphanages and making abortion legal are not mutually exclusive. You can do both at the same time. My point in bringing up orphanages is that some pro-choice opponents argue that women should give their children up for adoption instead of having an abortion. There are many children who never get adopted because they have the wrong color, age, health condition, etc. When adoption is mentioned as an alternative to abortion, it is assumed that the child will immediately be adopted which is often not the case. They end up staying in orphanages or foster homes where a lot of mistreatment occurs. And who wants to give up their child to a life that is WORSE than the one they can provide for them? Personally, that would stay on my conscience longer than an abortion would.
I agree with you that people SHOULD grow up and take responsibility when they have children, but that is not reality. Simply having a child does not automatically make someone mature and responsible, especially if they resent having the child in the first place.
And I disagree with you that "very few people of any sort of caliber will regret the experience and love of raising a child once it's all said and done." I know several people (both men and women) who STILL resent having children that they didn't plan. They don't say it explicitly because that would be frowned upon, but their actions say it every day in their subtle or obvious neglect, lack of total commitment to being a parent, etc.
For example, one man I know is married and is a great father to his oldest son, but he resents that his wife purposely got pregnant with their second son even after they both AGREED not to have anymore children. They made plans to finish raising their oldest son and then travel together. However, his wife changed her mind without telling him. To this day, seven years after his youngest son was born, he has yet to mention his son's name. Does this mean that he is not a person of "caliber"? No. He's a nice, responsible, loving father for the most part...but he definitely isn't as involved with his 2nd son as much. Is it his fault that he didn't want the second child? No. I'm not even sure if that is a conscious decision on his part, either. Still, don't you think his youngest son realizes this and is negatively affected?

Some women will even abort the fetus themselves with clothes hangers. This is not only a threat to the child but also to the mother. Therefore we need to give these women, a safe environment.

Partial Birth abortion is wrong. It's your responsibility to decide in the first trimester however. This is because...
(1) It's not murder. It's not murder to kill a tree, and at this point the baby is just as thoughtful as a tree.
(2) In courts, it would not be ruled double murder or manslaughter, since the court sees the fetus as too young to think

1817,abortion,"B.S.
I would like to see one good statistic (from a reliable source) supporting this statement.
I find this to be a very ill-informed conjecture, for several reasons.
1) It seems to me that the large majority (or all) child-abuse situations stem from deep pschylogical issues and emotional problems often rooted in past trauma and/or substance abuse. They have little to do with rational conflict/feelings between the child and parent. Rather, they are outward manifestations of inner anger from other sources. Therefore, this really has nothing to do with abortion (in most cases anyways).
2) This is based on the false assumption that most women want abortions because they hate or are angry at the baby. This of course is ridiculous, the baby has done nothing. I think it would be generally acceptable to say that most mothers want abortions out of fear or undesire to assume the responsibilities of motherhood. The only exception to this that I can think of is the occasional possibility of raped woman's anger being projected onto the baby. But even this I think can be in most cases resolved through therapy and most of all through raising the child and coming to love him/her as parenthood takes over.
3) Even if said anger/hate and potential abuse tendencies are present in the woman, I feel that the proper solution is for her to learn to improve the quality of her character and emotional stability (thereby improving her life eventually) rather than further degrade her character through murder. At the very least, if she feels she cannot do this, she should let the child be adopted into a family that can love him/her properly.",3,0,Pro-Choice
1817,abortion,"Of course the two aren't mutually exclusive, whether abortion is made illegal or not, orphanages should still be improved. My point is simply that the problem of "bad" orphanages shouldn't become an excuse for murder. If you have a bad problem you should fix it with good, not more bad. For those that do stay in the orphanages, I think of course that it is better for them to live in normal families, but I believe with proper care many can still be raised in a positive, healthy enviroment. As for those that are mistreated, I do not doubt that there are many. However, I do doubt that they make up the majority, in modern countries (especially the U.S.) at least. Even then I honestly do believe it is better to have lived than never to have lived at all. My personal opinion is that life is a profound thing that goes deeper than basic "good" or "bad" experiences. It consists of something greater.
Regardless, I return to my more solidly-based idea that, as a matter of moral principle, murder should not be the solution to difficult problems.
As far as the parents thing goes: You make some very solid points, and really, I agree with you. For those who don't mature (although I do believe many will) it is indeed bad for the child and his/her development, and in fact, it's tragic.

Second of all, you agreed with a misinterpretation of my statement about "it is a mature decision to leave raising apples to people who are better apple farmers" as being a pro-adoption argument. That statement I made is an argument for people not having the child to begin with, not giving up the child after it is born. So I don't know if you will still agree with me on that. :)
In your rebuttal, I'm noticing that you are taking my statements and then extrapolating a bit too much. You took my statement of not bringing more unwanted children into the world and then you said:
"Let me suggest a more humane alternative. Some children are adopted into loving families. Some are not. Why don't we kill all orphans six years old and older since those are not likely to get adopted. Wouldn't this be preferable to killing all of them? "
Arguing by exaggeration and sarcasm doesn't make as good of a counterargument as if you would argue using a comparable analogy. NOT bringing an unwanted child in the world isn't comparable to killing all orphans six years old and older because NOT DOING SOMETHING (not having a baby) is a passive non-action while DOING SOMETHING (killing children) is an aggressive action. Again, you're arguing apples and paper.
If you're going to try to make a convincing argument, I would suggest replying to what people actually say rather than an exaggeration of what they said. It would also be nice if when people are rebutting an argument that is a response to another person's argument, that people read the original argument, too. It provides more context...
The real difference between pro-choice people and pro-life people is the line that is drawn where it is considered murder. Obviously, pro-choice people draw the line at three months or before birth and pro-life people draw it at....well, they don't draw a line. I sincerely hope that pro-life people are consistent with that and don't believe in capital punishment, either. Because I really find that hypocritical...
Pro-choice proponents value the woman's right to choose over the baby's right to live. Simple as that. Pro-lifers like to throw in murder to muddy the debate waters and act as if people who are pro-choice have no morals and are random killers, which is simply ridiculous to me. I shouldn't have a right to tell someone else what to do with her body. Women are not simply conduits for life. They are thinking, living, breathing human beings. I don't see any pro-lifers getting this upset at dogs when they kill their young AFTER being born because they are sick and the mother knows they will not be able to survive alone. I also don't see pro-lifers getting up in arms about people KILLING HORSES just because they broke a leg. And I don't hear pro-lifers calling farmers murderers and giving up eating their eggs (CHICKEN BABIES!) or veal (LAMB BABIES!) in protest. A bunch of hypocrites.
This is the kind of topic that can go on FOREVER because it's damn near impossible to convince someone to think differently about which should be valued more: the woman who's already here or the baby that has yet to be born. Those are intrinsic values that people are hard pressed to change. I know that I will never be convinced to value an unborn child's right to live despite the woman who created that life not wanting the child.

1878,abortion,"Someone on the pro-life side brought up the real issue here: does life begin at conception, or at birth, or somewhere in between? It's logical that if life were to begin at conception, then abortion would be a pretty touchy issue: after all, ending a life is pretty clearly not a good thing to do in most circumstances (however, if childbirth would endanger the child or mother for medical reasons, there's still a choice to be made).
A child about to be born has most of the features of a child already born, including brain function, fingerprints, everything makes a human being unique. That's a living entity, in my mind.
HOWEVER, a first trimester foetus has no brain activity. It does not think, have memories, or feel any more pain than a carrot would. It may have a few features that humans have, but doctors excise cysts which have human features sometimes. A cyst is not a person, so we can say that features do not a human make.
The potential for life does not begin at conception either. Women ovulate monthly for years, men produce billions of sperm. The genetic material, children that could have been, it all goes to waste on a massive scale every day because we choose not to dedicate our lives to breeding. The reason that many people argue that life begins at conception has to do with their need to set a defensible instant when life does begin: it's not about truth emerging from facts, it's about our need to define a beginning.
I don't believe it's reasonable to argue that a collection of a few thousand cells, a piece of tissue which is being kept alive through the mother and cannot think, feel or remember, can be called alive. A "living person" to me means a being who can remember, who has experienced something, who is different from the cyst I referred to earlier and different from any other being conceived five minutes earlier or later, in a different womb.
An analogy occurs to me, oddly enough involving kids: My niece sometimes draws pictures for me. Each picture she draws is precious, irreplaceable, something I'll treasure and look after. However, she sometimes starts on a drawing and then crumples it up and throws it away after making a few lines, and I don't feel the urge to dig through the trash for those.

1878,abortion,"Interesting set of arguments, I'd like to try to address them:
First of all, that entire segment has an a priori assumption that personhood begins at conception. The author suggests that no one should accept a "pro-choicer's" definition of personhood on faith. Fine, but I don't see why we should necessarily accept his definition either. While I agree there there may be some degree of difficulty in determining when a growing foetus becomes a "person" as he defines it, I don't think that the easy definition is necessarily the right one. Constitutionally, a human being's charter rights and patrimony begin at birth. Isn't that a clear definition? I mention it for rhetorical purposes only.
The references to Nazi Germany are straw man fallacies. The author is clearly trying to appeal to the reader's emotions rather than sense. I'll discuss it at length if you insist, but I think it's pretty clear that we can throw those comments out of a rational discussion.
My point about the distinction between an unfeeling, unthinking collection of living cells as opposed to an unborn child: the former doesn't feel pain. It isn't aware of its existence. It has yet to affect the world of its own volition, hasn't made choices, hasn't started looking forward to anything. It won't even respond to bright light until the second trimester. In many ways it is still a part of the potential mother. While it could potentially develop into a human being, we can say the same of an UNfertilized egg.
Now, I'm confining my arguments to the first trimester. Several weeks BEFORE the foetus can feel anything. During the first trimester, many pregnancies self-abort through reabsorption of the embryo, particularly when the mother is underfed. By the reasoning often presented to me, if "abortion is murder," then these mothers should be charged with manslaughter, assuming they made every effort to preserve the embryo.
Discrimination isn't a crime: it just means "to see a difference." I see a difference between a truckload of lumber and a home, between a shelf of paints and a portrait. I see a difference between an agglomeration of cells and an unborn child, and for me that difference is that the child can react to stimuli (as of 8 weeks) and demonstrate rudimentary emotion (12 weeks). Data from here: http://www.spucscotland.org/education/beginningoflife/foetaldevelopment/
The fact-checking I've had time to do (limited though it may be) has changed my viewpoint somewhat, though: abortions as a form of birth control are an ugly thing. I won't support that beyond week 8, which is when the first signs of nervous activity appear. However, there are cases (such as ectopic pregnancy) where the growing baby will KILL the mother on its way out. Regrettably, at that point, there's a choice to be made on who gets to live. You can tell me the child is blameless, my answer has to be that nothing the mother did deserves the death penalty either. The mother has a life, family who know her, stories and experiences to share with the world, a person-sized place that will be left empty by her passing. I won't ever support any law that says she must die so that someone else can live, she has to make that decision herself.
A final thought: criminalizing abortion doesn't stop it. It just makes it beyond regulation. History bears this out as fact: remember the stories of knitting needles, coat hangers, back-alley butchers charging $300 without anaesthetic? The best thing you can do, whichever side of the debate you're on, is to support education about birth control and make it as readily available to people as possible. Keep the unwanted pregnancy from happening and we don't have to argue about what to do about it. Given the obvious social consequences of unplanned pregnancies, the government ought to support such options and subsidize birth control instead of wondering whether they should even teach sex ed in schools.
I guess, given the above, I'm not on any side of the debate any more: I don't think there's always a choice, but I certainly don't think that abortion should be illegalized... I can't really support what I see on either side of the central line, so maybe I should retire from this debate?

For those of you who are too lazy to read, I'll give you a 'small excerpt' from the reading:
I propose, then, that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. How does the argument go from here? Something like this, I take it. Every person has a right to life. So the fetus has a right to life. No doubt the mother has a right to decide what shall happen in and to her body; everyone would grant that. But surely a person's right to life is stronger and more stringent than the mother's right to decide what happens in and to her body, and so outweighs it. So the fetus may not be killed; an abortion may not be performed.
It sounds plausible. But now let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says. "Tough luck. I agree. but now you've got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him."

Parents would not consider the difficulties of bearing and raising children a mere "inconvenience." Waiting at a red light is an inconvenience. Taking a detour on a side road because of street repairs is an inconvenience. Parenting is the most difficult job a person can undertake, and doing it poorly can have devastating effects. Pro-choicers feel that parenting should only be done by people who truly wish to do so. We do not believe in forcing unwilling, unprepared people into parenthood.
And besides that, if pregnancy and childbirth is just a mere "inconvenience" what are they (PLers) comparing it to? If having a condition that threatens your health and wellbeing, your abilty to go to school, do your job, pay your rent, and force you to sacrifice your entire way of life and maybe some of your dreams is considered merely "inconvenient," then what do they consider a crisis?!

1189,abortion,"Such a statement shows gross ignorance of the extreme pain and suffering most birth mothers (women who give their children up for adoption) experience. It also ignores the health risks of pregnancy. Abortion is much healthier and safer for a woman than remaining pregnant and putting the unwanted child up for adoption. There are 135,000 children currently available for adoption in the United States alone. Why can't these childless couples take in two or three kids who are already here? What's actually in demand is healthy, white newborns, preferably male. If the child is older, disabled, retarded, has fetal alcohol syndrome, or is--heaven forbid--black, it stands very little chance of being adopted. It is not necessary to bring more children into the foster care system. Right now nearly everyone else involved in an adoption makes money off of it--the agency, the lawyer, etc., all except the person who did the hardest role of all, the birth mother. She's expected to give her services for free. As one person said, "Why should I work for nine months, and then give someone else the benefit?" It makes no more sense to expect that of a pregnant woman, then of an hourly or salaried employee.
And adoption is pretty much impossible for a married woman who already has all the children she wants. Imagine the trauma to them to watch their mother go through a pregnancy with a sibling of theirs, and to see her give it away, because they can't afford another child, or because she can't emotionally handle another one. It sends the message that BORN children are disposable, and is likeable to make the children she already has think, and not without justification, "If times get tough, are you going to give me/us away, too?"
There are many adoptees who are pro-choice, who even though they may be glad they weren't aborted by their birth mothers, still believe adoption should be an option, not an obligation. Sadly, there are also adopted children who are abused by their adopted parents, which is another reason some pregnant women don't want to have a child "out there" whose well-being they know nothing about.",3,0,Pro-Choice
1189,abortion,"Of all the questions posed by lifers, possibly the dumbest has to be, "What if your mother had aborted you?" If she had, I wouldn't be here to know the difference and I wouldn't care. My mother CHOSE to have me, and I wouldn't WANT her to have given birth to me if she only did so because she was FORCED. I respect my mother too much for that, which apparently is more than the lifers can claim about theirs. Makes me wonder if some of them have been told they were nearly aborted, and if they have vapors at the very thought, and can't comprehend that the world would not have noticed their absence and would have gotten along just fine without them.
I also wouldn't be here if my parents had married other partners, or if they had used birth control or abstained that night, or had conceived the previous night or the next night instead. Does that mean that it would have been wrong if they had? Of course not. I also wouldn't be here if my mother hadn't miscarried the one right before me, or if any other sperm but the one that got to the finish line first had been the winning one. In fact, maybe if I'd been aborted, my parents would have had a different child who might have been much nicer than me, but we'll never know.
It's the things that happen AFTER we arrive that make us special--the treatment we get from our family and friends, our education, the lives we in all our limitations are able to touch--not the things that happen BEFORE. Other than in the case of sperm or ova that contain the blueprints for genetic anomalies, granted, each is different, but most likely, just as good as another. You are obviously not your brother or sister, obviously, but GENETICALLY, are pretty much equal.
Didn't conceive this month? Fear not--next month's ovum crop will probably be just as good. Aborted a fetus? Not to worry, the one you have when you're good and ready to have a baby will be just as good, and probably better, because it's POST-BIRTH experiences will be more positive then if it had been the end result of an unwanted pregnancy.
And there are probably some people who would answer the question, "Aren't you glad your mother didn't abort you?" with "No," because she died in childbirth, and the surviving family has never let them live it down since.

1840,abortion,"When people debate "Pro-choice vs. Pro-life," they frequently miss the crux of the argument. It is not always the debater's fault; the label "Pro-life" obscures the point that is truly being debated. I believe most people would say they are "Pro-life" in that they value human life and do not condone thoughtlessly throwing away any life. The argument, however, is not about the sanctity of life. It is about human, especially women's, rights. If one side is labeled "Pro-life," it implies that the opposing side is "Anti-life," a gross misrepresentation of the Pro-choice viewpoint. The Pro-choice movement does not encourage women to abort any child they may be impregnated with. It argues that a woman should be legally able to choose to keep her child or not, and, if she chooses not to keep her child, to have access to a safe and legal abortion*.
The Anti-choice movement maintains that life begins at conception**, and thus aborting a pregnancy is killing that life. By destroying an unborn, or "preborn" baby's life, a mother is committing murder. Murder is, of course, illegal and so abortion should be illegal as well. By this reasoning, a woman should not legally "the choice to murder people without consequence"***. Indeed, if everyone was able to agree when life began and if everyone believed that abortion is fundamentally immoral, then abortion would equate to murder.
By insisting that abortion is murder, however, the Anti-choice movement not only forces its specific beliefs, religious or otherwise, on slightly more than half the population of the United States, but also overlooks the entire debate of choice. Although Wigg1es, a member who argues in favor of "Pro-life," states that "abortion is murder, plain and simple"***, it does not matter in this particular debate how vehemently opposed to abortion one is unless she herself is the woman making the choice whether or not to have her child. The morality of abortion is a different argument entirely (if it is even arguable, as every individual has his or her own personal system of morality).
Debating that abortions are immoral against those who are trying to protect women's privacy and safety regardless of personal beliefs is erroneous. It simply does not follow. The Anti-choice movement is founded in this logical fallacy. It attempts to defeat the efforts of the Pro-choice movement by slinging around terms like "murder" and "infanticide" without considering the opposition that exists outside the "Pro-life" coverall of morality. It blatantly ignores the realities of accidental pregnancies and women who will choose abortion whether or not it is legal and safe. I pose this question: can anyone solidly oppose a woman's right to privacy and safe treatment without looking through the lens of moral value?

The death penalty
War
These things all include someone being killed against their will (which is what pro-lifers are trying to protect). Although they are different topics we all run into conflicts within ourselves. Lets take for instance war, If we support war we support people dying because they had to go overseas, realizing these people did sign up for the military on their own, with the knowledge that they could potentially go overseas and fight. They still signed up to support their country. Are we to assume that our soldiers going overseas AND their families, AND their friends are all pro choice because they obviously support their family member/ friend. Therefore they also have to support death against the one dyings will?... I dont think so. If you are a supporter of life, by all means, no matter what, no exceptions then there is no way NO WAY you can support any war. EVEN if YOUR life depended on it. This is why self education and consistency is a must have on either side . Being pro choice or pro life is more than abortion.. abortion is just the more sensitive of the topics at hand.

There is a difference between standing up for God, and restricting the rights of others.
If abortion is wrong from purely a religious standpoint then your asking the government to legislate your religious values on people that do not necessarily share them.
And if abortions are illegal these people won’t convert and share your values, but they will simply be introduced to less safe illegal abortions which could result in both mother and child being lost.
Your God has told you to be in the world but not be of the world. You are called to act as you think God says is morally correct, but you have to respect the opinions of others. The moment you step in to stop abortion and tell others that their morals are less than admirable your crossing a line and that is not ok. By doing this you will come across as a self-righteous bigoted ass (regardless of weather you are or are not one to begin with)
So how do you operate? You as an individual can choose not to have abortions, you can choose to try and get your church to hold “family building seminars” (where young parents are taught how to budget, health information, etc), Free (or low cost) child care, counselling, etc. This way your doing something progressive rather than holding up a sign and giving people bad impressions. You can support people who choose to not have abortions, and you can also choose to support people who do have them (after all that is whats loving and thats what Jesus would do)
You can petition for improved sex ed so that pregnancies can be prevented (which means that abortions can be prevented as well). You can petition for there to be members in abortion clinics who make sure that the girls are concealed and not coerced into the procedure.
What you can’t do its tell people its wrong, stop it from happening, and rely on your religion for that to happen. Thats shoving your values down others throats, thats comparable to putting religion in government (which is all fine and good for people who follow the religion, but not for people who don’t.. ie. if the US had a Hindu government who said your morals and worldview were wrong, I’m pretty sure you’d be protesting your rights to be a Christian and would be offended.

"but, if people just followed God's laws and made good choices there would be no need for abortion.” -- Assuming your referring to new testament laws, then yes they wouldn't. But heres your problem, Not everyone is a christian and recognizes these laws. Not all christians obey these laws either.
"I agree that people (in general, not just christians) should petition for education concerning pregnancy”
-- Not just pregnancy, but what sort of cost is associated with a child, the risks of stds, the use of contraceptives etc.
"the heart is "decietfully wicked" and people do evil things.”
-- So the young girl who had a poor education, and an older man professed his love for her. In her naivety she had sex with him and became pregnant. He runs off and she is stuck with being pregnant, being young, and having no way to take care of the baby or deal with the social implications and has an abortion. YOur calling her evil? your calling her wicked? This was probably not your intention, but this is how it can be interpreted
"Many times the things leading a woman to get an abortion is because of evil”
-- lets use the example of someone I know. A church pastor (when she was under the age of consent) professed his love for her and she was naive. They had sex, she got pregnant. He ran away.
What are here repercussions if she keeps the baby? She’ll be a social outcast, the church will talk about her and scorn her, she will not be able to take care of the child because of her age, she will have to stop school to do it, she does not want to carry the child of the man who abused his power to persuade her into a relationship.

Yes the rape, incest, etc are horrible things. But these are not the only considerations during abortions.
Theres the family consequences, the relationship consequences, the social consequences, the economic consequences. Not to mention the fact that pregnancy is not pleasant and can have medical consequences. Theres also the time it is going to take. It will change your whole life. Adoption only deals with some of the economic factors. There will be tons of emotional damage from having to cary the baby to term and give it up.
"Condoms don't protect your heart” -- some people don’t have the same standards as you do, and sex with condoms outside of marriage is seen as part of a healthy relationship. Again, this is going with the whole personal values and morals thing we spoke about.

Jumping to try and shut it down is not constructive and will lead to suffering. Putting out resources, improving education, being respectful, being supportive, etc. These are the things that will be constructive.
"I completely agree, more needs to be done to help these women who have unwanted pregnancies. But the way to help them isn't to convince them to kill thier child.”
-- and suggesting that its either A) killing a child or B) forcing them to have a baby is also wrong.
Pro choice is not about convincing people to kill children. Its about giving education, preventing pregnancies by use of education on contraceptives, and abstinence (While an abstinence only education is flawed, it does have merits so long as people do realize that they could mess up and have a back up plan like condoms). Pro choice is actually aimed at trying to prevent pregnancies before abortion comes up as an *option*.

What if we switch “ten Commandments” With “Buddhist Precepts”?
The Five Precepts are the basis of Buddhist morality. The first precept is to avoid killing or harming living beings. The second is to avoid stealing, the third is to avoid sexual misconduct, the fourth is to avoid lying and the fifth is to avoid alcohol and other intoxicating drugs.
The evidence for the five precepts:
After we have stopped doing bad, we then commence to do good. Take for example, speech. The Buddha says we should start by refraining from telling lies. After that, we should speak the truth, speak gently and politely and speak at the right time. He says:
"Giving up false speech he becomes a speaker of truth, reliable, trustworthy, dependable, he does not deceive the world. Giving up malicious speech he does not repeat there what he has heard here nor does he repeat here what he has heard there in order to cause variance between people. He reconciles those who are divided and brings closer together those who are already friends. Harmony is his joy, harmony is his delight, harmony is his love; it is the motive of his speech. Giving up harsh speech his speech is blameless, pleasing to the ear, agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, liked by most. Giving up idle chatter he speaks at the right time, what is correct, to the point, about Dhamma and about discipline. He speaks words worth being treasured up, seasonable, reasonable, well defined and to the point.” - Gautama, Buddha

If the mother can't afford the child, how is its life going to be? It would grow up, live in poverty, and probably suffer. Kids are expensive these days. Would ya rather have a child have to live through suffering for years, or have it (and its mother) be spared poverty?
The mother has a job, but a child would just get in the way. So if the child is born, what happens? The mother loses her job, and the kid's living in poverty. Back to the previous argument.
Too young. So if the person is, in their opinion, too young, they need to be forced to have the child? You said "you make the decision of having a child at the bed". So if the woman didn't want the child, she couldn't have sex at all? No matter the protection, there's always a chance of pregnancy. You're suggesting, it seems, that if she doesn't want a child she doesn't have sex. That, to me, seems unfair on the woman. She should be let to do what she wants without being forced to unnecessary measures.
Want to wait. Well, if she wants children later in life, but you force them on her now, is she still going to want them? Maybe the experience of motherhood would be ruined for her, because she was made to do something she, given her choice, would not have picked.",3,0,Pro-Choice

If a woman is irresponsible enough to continually get pregnant, do we really want this kind of woman raising children? Think about it. If a woman, any woman, has decided that she does not want or cannot care for a child, she is probably making the best decision for all involved.
Why do you think there are so many people in the American criminal justice system? Many of these people probably should have been aborted. I know that sounds so cold and so cruel, but what good have they been to society? They've stolen, murdered, battered, defrauded, and so much more. I ask you, what is sadder, a lifetime spent behind bars or a life that was ended before it even began? And even more so, if they get the death penalty, aren't we ultimately performing an abortion, just many years later? We are aborting a member from society. I would be so bold as to say that if you are pro-life you are anti-death penalty.
My point is, many women abort because they know in their hearts that they cannot care for a child, and cannot bear the thought of a child growing up in adoption agencies. Some may argue, "well, she shouldn't have gotten pregnant in the first place." Well she did, and unfortunately with pregnancy, once the ball has started rolling, that baby is coming unless something is done to stop it.

"Her embryo" - actually, the embryo is dually possessed. She has an egg. Man contributes sperm.
"vital organs" - umm, does this mean that it is acceptable to kill people who lose important organs? Doubtful.
"brain waves" - brain waves are not the end-all of determining life. Besides which with/without brain waves, the fetus responds to stimuli as early as nine weeks, and later enters REM sleep, tastes, hears, etc. Thus, an abortion is the destruction of a responsive life (at least after nine weeks).
Is my idea Nazi-like? Of course. But it's honest. To say that the "pro-choice" of abortion is the woman's choice is like saying that a mother can kill her 5 yr old simply because the baby came from her body.

You say:

You say:
"ok who are we too say what life deserves to live or die.That's God's descision."
OK, so let God decide if the foetus is viable or not - if it will survive or not. If this is a first trimester foetus, God is likely to decide that it should not survive. If this is in the last trimester, God is likely to decide that it should survive. Middle trimester - ??? God's will, I guess (or, if you prefer, natural selection).
This is a WIN-WIN scenario.
The mother is not forced to be pregnant against her will - she wins. And GOD gets to make his decision as to who lives or dies - GOD wins....

I would be very interested in your ideas regarding my (described a few times above) proposal: instead of killing the foetus (abortion), why not offer the option of 'immediate delivery'? That does not force anyone to anything...and a foetus in an advanced stage of development (and thus likely sentient) would have a very high probability of survival....and there would be no direct killing of anyone...
And it would be much more comparable to your (or, Asimpleman's) analogy: a 5-year-old is capable of happy survival in foster care, away from the 'birth mother'. I am proposing that when a woman no longer wishes to host the foetus, it would be delivered.

Many readers of their literature then assume that embryos can feel pain from this point in pregnancy onwards. However all available evidence shows that even though these sensors develop early in pregnancy, human embryos cannot actually sense pain. Certain major components of the central nervous system that are necessary to feel pain are not present and functioning.
One can only imagine the needless pain and anxiety felt by women who believe -- on the basis of some pro-life literature -- that their embryos have suffered pain during an abortion, miscarriage, or emergency treatment for an ectopic pregnancy.
Many physicians and medical researchers believe that fetuses can begin to feel pain sometime during the third trimester. This is long after:

- "Banning it would only the make the practice more private." that's the case even with banning other crimes, such as theft, murder, etc. Although some abortions might go underground, some will stop. Since the US legalized urestricted abortion in 1973, there was a significant INCREASE in abortions. Moreover, in 1992, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey imposed certain restrictions on abortion, the number of abortions suddenly DROPPED. This supports my claim that banning abortions will reduce them to some extent.

1) The Life inside the woman is a seperate organism, the mother is just the host. The DNA of the fetus has a different genetic make-up then the host mother.

In today's circumstance you can always give the child up for adoption etc. The most common claim that I here is that the fetus can't live outside the mother andf is defenseless. Well how about a child who is 1 week old. Left outside because its mother didn't want it? Pretty much the same result. But one is considered murder the other isn't?
2) The fetus begins to develop the instance it is concieved. The child begins to "feel" around the third week. Its brain and nervous system starting to grow fully araound the 4-5 week. Only one month out of nine. The fetus is not a lifeless blob. It develops over the course of the nine months and becomes a full organism.

Abortion where it is not unlawful is something that today is frowned upon by many and is considered outrageous.

Is it acceptable for those people to kill Mexican immigrants since the recognition of their humanity isn't universal?

2532,abortion,"I'd like to respond to a lot of these comments:
1. What happens to those who practice it? The same thing that happens now to people who perform illegal procedures or murder (depending on how abortion was made illegal).
2. Law does not exist to 'teach' us that something is wrong. Law against abortion would exist to protect the lives of the babies, not to teach that abortion is wrong.
3.(a.) If you are actually protecting the life of the mother this would be a triage situation (although I very unsure how an abortion could be 'saving the ... child from death'). (b.) How could we possibly determine that a child in the Sudan would be better left unborn? It may be that child that suffer and starves that will grow up an change the situation in Sudan.
4. This is a fascinating statement. I've mostly heard woman (and most of them mothers) argue against abortion, not men. Aside from which, the validity of an argument is not really dependent on the source. We may question/test and argument more because of the source, but good arguments will stand.
In short, your first 4 arguments give no support to your position because most, if not all, are non sequiturs.
Now, your 3 points and following. We could say that the law has three possible solutions to murder (or theft, or rape, etc.): (1.) All people must murder. (2.) All people must not murder. (3.) People have the choice to murder.
Does this mean that we should take position #3 because it's not the extreme view?
You completely ignore the issue of whether or not the fetus is life. If the fetus is life, then abortion is just as much a political issue as murdering, rape, or theft. Abortion would be the infringement of the right to life of that fetus. Wouldn't taking that right be tantamount to acting pompously toward them? Note here, I'm not talking religiously, nor am I talking about the right of the mother. If the baby is alive, it has rights, and doesn't the government have the responsibility of protecting those rights?
Okay, your last three points:
1. Like your first original statement, this is a non sequitur. Neither the punishment nor the relative success of a law are not the reasons for passing the law. The law wold be to protect human beings.
2. You do however, have the right to protect those who can't protect themselves. If you saw a man beating a child to death, I doubt we would find it acceptable if someone claimed, 'I didn't have the right to stop that guy from beating his kid.'
3. But what about those who have the experience? Besides which, this again ignores the issue of human rights. Do I have to own a slave to know that killing a slave is wrong?

Also many in the medical field view the embryo and/or zygote as human because of his/her genetic makeup.

Punishment: i doubt that a punishment for the actual would be mother would exist. If would most likely be the doctor's who would be punished. Most likely through a hefty fine or a stipping of their license. The "back alley docs" would, if caught, either be fined or go to jail for practicing medicine without a license.
- Situation pending: Abortions due to rape, incest, and threatening of the mother's life are a statistical rarity. Any legislation passed because of this would be a rule for the exception. Why dont we let Sudan deal with their abortion laws and we'll deal with ours. But in terms of bringing an American baby into a world of poverty, one of the very few things i agree with Obama on are that there should be some sort of governmental child support. Its not fair and its illogical to force people to have a baby if they cant afford it. This does however, delve into the whole "being responsible" thing.
- Men: I think men should have a lot more say in this than they do. Men dont have to be pregnant, they dont have to carry that baby around for 9 months, they dont go through the physical or emotional toll that pregnancy takes on mothers. But they do have to pay child support. Regardless of what the man wants, if the woman wants to have that kid, the man has to fork over the money. If you're going to say you are Pro-Choice, then it has to go both ways.
Positions of Abortion:
Why are those the official positions? THey arent correct and they paint an extremist picture. I think the two positions on abortion are the two major ones we have today.
1. Abortion should be left up to the mother, as it is her choice.
2. Abortion should be outlawed, as it is immoral to society.
You're damn right Abortion is a moral issue. There is nothing political about it. Most of the people in this country think abortion is abhorrent.

"Abortion is a moral issue, yes I agree with you....but everyones morals are different. Why should we do something because some people think its wrong according to their morals - that come from religion or they way they were grown up."
Ok well first off, the moral opposition to abortion isnt based on religion..its based on flat unbiased moral sense. Second, remember what i said to Juggernaut. The American divide on this issue is about whether or not a woman should have the right to choose, not whether abortion is ok. No politician is Pro-Abortion, they are Pro-Choice. The reason for that is because no politician would get votes if they flat out said "Hi i'm running for president and i want you all to know that i'm perfectly cool with killing human babies, vote for me." They wouldnt get elected because the majority of Americans think abortion is wrong.

I am glad you have not lost your sense of moving from the ridiculous to the absurd in a single statement. What does any of this have to do with China or forced abortions? We are talking about whether or not a woman can choose for herself.
A legitimate child is a child who is born. There right to legitimacy is not predicated on your sense of morality and we are all thankful for that.

If you, like VR, believe "the woman should not have intimate sex unless she is prepared to settle down and take responsibility for what might result of it from the man"...surely then, the same rules must apply to the man...or, I'm afraid, you got it right...you are sexist.
The lesson, proposed by VR...to be learned by the woman...will then also be learned by the man. "...What's good for the goose...is good for the gander!" ;) If a man is not prepared to father and care for a potential child...he better not attempt to spread seeds!

1) Perhaps, like most people, she had sex for the sex. By all means, she should have used reliable contraception. However, not everyone gets real sex education and not all methods are reliable, so unwanted pregnancies still happen. I'd like for them to happen less, but we have to deal with the ones that happen now, and there's absolutely no sense to punishing the woman by forcing her to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term. This is pure misogny and you should be ashamed of yourself. I've certainly lost any respect I might have had for you.
2) These are options, and so is abortion. Let the woman choose instead of trying to force your choice on her.
3) An unborn life is the same as not a life. You don't get to round up only when it's convenient for you.
4) Population is a real issue, particularly since every American has a huge carbon footprint compared to a third-worlder. The world is indeed overpopulated as compared to what it can sustainably support. If you disagree, that's only because you're ignorant.

This baby would be a permanant reminder of that horrible night, and the mother might even neglect the baby because of it.
Another point which was raised by my dad, is abortion up to 24 weeks. I DON'T agree with this. I just looked up a photo of a baby which was aborted at 24 weeks, and it made me feel physically sick.

If this was true of an adult human he would be pronounced dead.
The fetus is also incapable of suffering due to its lack of nerves and therefore abortion is not cruel either, as some would claim.
The only other reason a person might be opposed to abortion is if they wish to give every fetus a chance at life. (This claim sort of contradicts the claim that a fetus is already human, but that's not my point now.)

As for your Beethoven fallacy, my argument concerning avoiding sex being wrong adressed just this issue. You are arguing that aborting a fetus could take away the future of that child. But really, doesn't abstaining from sex do exactly the same thing? Wouldn't the world be just as deprived of Beethoven's music if his parents just didn't do it as if he was aborted? Haven't we lost just as much talent, if not more so, by not having sex? Really, your argument is completely meaningless.

Leaving out social pressure and mandated child support (both of which can be avoided or ignored), the man can simply walk away from the "consequences," while to the woman they are long-term, life-altering, and even potentially fatal.
So although I am not in favor of it on a personal level, I see abortion as a way of making the consequences equal.

Is a woman committing murder every month that she does not allow an egg to be fertilized by having sexual intercourse? And would you even think of punishing her for it? Also, you asked me to consider the fish's feelings. I'm sure the fish would not be pleased at all, but my point was that we generally don't have moral qualms about killing a fish, and that to have such qualms about killing a fetus with similar, and in fact lesser abilities than that fish is an inconsistency.

Should jerking off be illegal? You are killing babies when you do that. No, no that's not "life" jerking off should be legal. How about when the egg is fertilized. Sure that sounds good, killing a fertilized egg is murder. But if a pregnant woman loses the fertilized egg (which happens rather frequently) she would be subject to involuntary man slaughter. Right? She killed a baby, maybe not on purpose, but she killed it. She's a murderer, by definition.
What your left with is a whole lot of gray about when life begins. Nobody can prove when life begins, even what life is. You may have your own beliefs about what life is and when it begins, but you can prove nothing.
So if an abortion violates your beliefs or theology, dont have an abortion. Thats your own choice. But don't tell me I cant have an abortion because you think its wrong.

So, I can't prove that the fetus is not alive and you cant prove its alive. Thats the basis of my argument. Since we cant tell for sure what "it" is, how can the government come in and declare it a living entity which deserves legal protection. I have the same argument for brain dead people. I, personally, consider them dead when the brain is dead. But who really knows when life is over, or what life is for that matter, so how can the government come in and tell my family I'm alive and you cant let me go? Because these issues are so philosohpical in nature I argue that the government should just mind their own business and let individuals decide based on their own beliefs.

337,abortion,"This is a debate in itself. In brief, there are two types of rights, negative and positive rights. Roughly speaking, the former prevent action and the latter impose an obligation to act.
Consider now abortion and theft. Theft is an infringement on the (negative) right to sanctity of property. By making a law against theft, one is preventing infringement by one person upon another's rights. That's easy to understand.
On the other hand, a law against abortion could be either a negative or a positive right, depending upon whether one considers the fetus to be protected by the ordinary rules applying to society. If the fetus is alive, then abortion becomes an issue of murder, the right to life being a negative right. If not, then a law against abortion is a positive imposition upon the parents, infringing upon their rights rather than preventing them from infringing upon another's.
As a matter of fact, the status of the fetus is in question. The default position should be that government takes no action (no action without cause). It follows that abortion is legal, except when it can be established beyond reasonable doubt that the rights of the fetus are being infringed.
I have just explained the position of US jurisprudence. Their compromise is that the fetus is considered alive and entitled to rights in the third trimester. It's a reasonable compromise.

337,abortion,"teachme, I agree with you. I'd just like to add one thing: an early-stage fetus is alive in precisely the same sense that an appendix is alive... yet we don't see doctors getting lynched for performing appendectomies.
This suggests to me that a large segment of the population is ignorant of basic biology. Perhaps that's why the same segment tends not to believe in evolution?
Conventionally, the line has been drawn at the point where the fetus is able to survive independent of the mother. Perhaps a better place to draw it would be at the point at which the fetus attains consciousness. But it's not even clear whether this happens before or after birth.
RodMcFeely's Hindu Cow argument is telling: what are the criteria that must be met to be considered a member of a society and entitled to its protections? I'd be interested to know whether there are any vegans who think waterboarding terrorists is acceptable. I also find it curious that the religiously-minded have no problem torturing the aforementioned terrorists and executing criminals, but scream bloody murder when an abortion is performed on a fetus that is unconscious, unable to function without its mother, and has less of a sense of individuality than your average cow.

No Unprotected sex due to a lack of education causes high teen pregnancy rates. Or overly religious (or conservative) parents who Don’t adequately prepare their children for it adds to it
Example: Son, If you have sex before marriage your disowned and God will be angry. Boy later gets into a heated situation gives into his hormones and boom Early parenthood.. Could have been prevented if his parents were smart and said “we’d like you wait till marriage but if you do decide to do it wear a condom.”
Making abortion Illegal is taking rights away from women, will cause there to be children brought up with inadequate care, and will create illegal abortions that are very unsafe and could cause the death of both the mother and unborn.
Some kids now-a-days are abstinent even with that option. Educated ones who are not abstinent practice safe, sex (though there are some accseptions). Promoting Education and getting rid of some social stigmas is far better than forcing a young girl to become a parent before she is ready (emotionally and financially) and forcing the child to be brought up in less than desirable circumstances.
And calling pregnant teens “Stupid spoiled whores” is offensive and wrong. It makes you an ass. And if your religious it makes you a hypocrite, wheres the love man? You don’t know these girls, you don’t know the circumstances. besides you can look around and see some teen moms who still don’t understand responsibility, both in the real world or on “reality” tv.

I never implied that you were a crazy religious type who is going to be violent to people of different mindsets. But your bible does mention something about unwholesome language/name-calling being wrong. So I called you out when you associated pregnant teens to "stupid spoiled whores" It was a bad generalization and even if it was just an observation it was rude to say. Hence “where is the love”
Without religion it depends on how you define a person and what value you place on that. Abortion can be absolute fine or wrong depending on the individual. Here’s a thought. Don’t like it? don’t do it. Let others live their own lives.",3,0,"Abortion should be legal"
912,abortion,"Emotional and physical yes (Spiritual.. well you’d have to prove there is such a thing as spirit)
Handing out contraceptives (like condoms) in school, explaining the risks involved, having councillors, and information on sexual health is part of what school can do with education. Hence why It would be better to improve education rather than force people to have unwanted children that they cannot support.
The child will also never experience pain, hate, loss, remorse, regret, it will never suffer. It will never be sad. I could take your logic and say that every time one baby is conceived countless others are killed (a man does not just produce one sperm but many)
Furthermore your God gave everyone a choice, he is pro-choice. If he was pro-life we’d be in eden.

As much as pro lifers would like to make choice about fetus personhood they ignore the realities of womanhood. They ignore the fact that it takes 2 to tango, but one to suffer the consequences. They belittle the consequences and say things like “give it up for adoption” without considering the realities of things like job loss and education that are not inconvenient, but ruining in the long term. One of the most important factors in women's advancement in society has been their ability to control their fertility. More than any law, the ability for a woman to chose when to become pregnant has led to higher rates of education and employment success.
Let me make this clear… when the Founding Fathers lived…. Abortion was LEGAL.
Abortion did not become illegal until 1857. Before then midwives distributed herbs and root mixtures to cause abortion, then called “quickening”. The group? The AMA! A large part of this push for criminalization was an attempt to push midwives out of the market in order to open up more patients for doctors. The bases of their argument was not moral, but instead nativist. Look up Dr. Horatio R. Storer, the leader of the criminalization movement. He was a bigot who believed whites needed to outbreed natives, and he also included midwifery with native “uncivilization”.
The AMA did not just fight for criminalization, but also abortion under special circumstances, thus, giving the male physician total control over who may have abortions, forcing midwives out of business and establishing a medical patriarchy. This continued through the 20th century with the institutionalization of health care which did nothing to stop abortion, but drove it underground.
Through the 1950s and 1960s abortions became more difficult, more dangerous, and more expensive to obtain. This led to reform legislation long before Roe v. Wade. By 1967 12 states had already passed legislation. The battle for most of US history was not a moral one, but one of womens place in society, patient rights, and civil liberties.
Some argue the cycle of child birth and rearing is a consequence for actions, personal responsibility bla bla bla, in other words I know enough to force my opinion on a decision I have not had to make, and for the guys, never will. When we say “consequences” we mean consequence, singular, for the woman, doubled in guilt through blame of questioning morality to be in the situation to begin with.
In the words of Supreme Court justices O'Connor, Kennedy and Souter: "At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life."
This is seen as immoral in our society by some, yet Viagra commercials are acceptable.
We can debate about teaching abstinence in school, yet have no problem with erectile dysfunction drug companies handing out pens to our doctors.

Even in a perfect society where we are educated, have ready access to contraceptives, unique and individual cases arise that must be looked at with an objective and clear eye each and every time.

Of course, there have been cases of patients that recover from what is considered brain death. All this means, however, is that brain death is also open for debate.

You have a point about providing sources. I didn't know you were expecting me to be Mr. Academic. You can also do your own investigation.

4045,abortion,"Now here is a lack of logic: "All life on Earth was created, and...it is wrong to deprive an unborn child of its God given right to live." You are assuming two things: 1) All life on Earth was created; and 2) God exists. These are mere assertions without empirical basis.
Let's assume God did create all life on Earth and ignore evolution for now. You also say this means only God "should" take life away. Well, God does. God is the ultimate abortionist. Miscarriages (or natural abortions) are far greater than intentional abortions. If we do not have the right, why should God? Since the baby is innocent, God is a jerk. More precisely, God is a murderer.
Your "human centered" view leaves out the other life God "created." Let's look at biology. If you eat animals you are often eating something more advanced than a human fetus. You are then a worse murderer. Tell me how it's not all relative. "Well, animals no souls, we yes souls." We are animals! (We're all innocent as animals.)
If God decided to miscarry my earlier form for no particular ascertainable reason, I would also not "be here." That (God abortion) was more likely than a people abortion.

2,abortion,"I brought up the issue of rape cases in response to ramonaskinner and that other person (3rd post on left side) who claimed that abortion should be illegal flat-out, making no exceptions for extenuating circumstances. For you, just ignore that.
I see a clump of cells as of lesser importance for 2 reasons: 1. it is not yet sentient (the mother is) and 2. it's survival until birth is not certain. Also, the law does not currently recognize a fetus as a legal person.
1. I am not aware of the statistics relating to health concerns and late-term abortions. Certain governments regulate late-term abortions, so I don't think that we should necessarily take up space arguing this right now.
2. This is true, there is no fail-safe birth control.
3. I see this as a reason that abortions should be legal, and more widely accepted. If abortions were more readily available, and therefore controlled, governments would be more able to regulate the procedure and ensure that the doctors performing the operation are competent. Illegal abortions would not stop people from seeking to abort. This would create a similar situation to that during prohibition. People who wanted alcohol, bought moonshine. This resulted in far greater poisonings than with regular alcohol. If doctors cannot perform abortions in regulated settings, people will seek back alley abortions from "doctors".
4. This argument is based on the assumption that the child will survive and also on the belief that life is in itself a positive. Philosophers are divided on the claim that "life itself" is an inherent 'good'. Also, I was not saying that these potential mothers are not competent, I was merely saying that perhaps their current circumstance prevented them from being proper parents (i.e. being 16, being in school, being too underemployed to provide for themselves and a child). This will not stop them from being excellent parents later in life.
5. I totally agree on this point. Also I think this is how schools that teach birth control methods currently do things (I was taught this way when I was in high school).",3,0,Yes
2,abortion,"All I am saying is that the mother constitutes a legal person (a fetus does not) and therefore her rights trump a potential child (I stress potential). No, if a woman gets pregnant despite all her efforts then she is extremely fertile. This has nothing to do with fate.
Saying that the mother cannot abort the fetus because she is responsible for it is begging the question. I do not accept that the fetus has rights, therefore how does the mother owe it anything?
If a woman suffers a traumatic rape, then she is not pouring her anger out on the fetus. Perhaps she is not at a stage in her life at which she wants a child. Or is capable of having one. What if the rape victim were 13? Should this 13 year old girl (yes, girl) be forced to become a mother when she is so young? If you were the child of such an attack, would you want to live your life knowing that your mother always associated you with the event? What if you were the victim, and what if you always associated the child with the attack? How is that fair to the child?
No, it is not the child's fault. But you know what? It's not the mother's fault either. Why should she have to suffer, and possibly ruin her entire life because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time?
"A mistake will never be corrected by doing another mistake": also begging the question. I do not accept your premise, so why would I accept an identical conclusion?

4907,abortion,"It is a woman's prerogative. Carrying a fetus to term, giving birth, and ensuring proper care and education of another human being is an enormous responsibility. The energy that it requires is solely responsible for the social division of the sexes, and the burden it puts on women causes them to become second-class citizens in many cultures and throughout much of human history. Becoming pregnant too young drastically reduces the opportunities for women and makes them dependent on individuals (usually husbands) who can share the burden. It has been said that with great power comes great responsibility. I would like to propose the converse – with great responsibility come the right to the corresponding power. If women are naturally put in the position of responsibility for the lives they bring into the world, due to being solely burdened with the pregnancy, then they should also be entitled to the right to decide when and if they will do so. From this perspective, the mother’s inherent responsibility overrides the prospective child’s right to life until responsibility for the child's bodily existence can at least be shared or passed onto another willing individual. If this is not the case, then the mother’s life becomes captive to the State that would protect the prospective child’s life at the expense of the woman’s rights. It has been said that women already have the right to decide when they get pregnant by controlling when they have sex. However, while sex is the only way to get pregnant, that is not the only reason to have sex. Sex is also important for forging satisfying romantic relationships, which have their own intrinsic value for increasing happiness and life fulfillment aside from reproduction. So requiring women who do not currently want to have children to forgo sex all together to prevent accidental pregnancy requires them to deprive themselves of an important tool for creating and sustaining meaningful relationships, and creates unfair pressure for them to let go of other ambitions because they have to be ready for the possibility of parenthood. This is ironic given that building truly lasting and stable relationships that can best support a child often takes practice with several different partners over a course of years. This is not to say that happy marriages never emerge among first loves, just that it is rare and most people need space to learn and practice. In today’s society, both women and men need the freedom to be able to have serious, romantic sexual relationships long before they are prepared to have children. Part of this is because bringing up modern members of society requires much more investment in education and training before becoming self-sufficient and productive adults that no longer depend on their parents. People want to give their children the biggest advantage that they can, and for many that involves being educated well into adulthood and waiting until “the nest” is as well supplied and stable as possible – these days that often is not achieved until almost 15 years after puberty. It is not reasonable to expect adults to remain abstinent for that long, or for accidents not to happen. I am not saying that all women should get abortions for every unexpected pregnancy and should never sacrifice other goals for the unexpected accidental person found inside her. But it should be the woman's decision whether she is ready and in a position to make the sacrifice to responsibly carry a baby to term, or if the burden would be too great on her, her family, her partner, and on her current or future children. This can and should depend on her personal values and beliefs in addition to her situation, and some women should never get an abortion if it is something that they cannot live with. This creates room to celebrate the sacrifice a woman makes of her body and life when she does decide to give birth from an unexpected pregnancy, because it was indeed a beautiful *choice*. And if she does not, then that is her right and privilege as a woman. It is not a choice that any except a few depraved individuals would ever take lightly.",3,0,"It's right"
4911,abortion,"All right:
While a fetus may be just a bunch of cells that feels nothing until birth or an actual being who feels everything, who are we to judge what other people do? Why do WE need to choose what is right for people? I understand religious morals; however, haven't we already defecated on and gone against numerous religious morals already for it to not matter anymore?
FIRSTLY, people at least 95% of the time fail to take into account the number of women that DO want the child they are supposed to be having, but do not have the finances to care for it. While she may love her child to absolute death, how would it be fair for that child to have to live off of hand-me-downs from distant cousins and two dollar shirts that are too small or large from the Salvation Army? What if the child has no meals except for lunch on weekdays at school(due to that free/reduced lunch agreement some schools have)? Now, pretending that this is all an actual scenario, this child will not be able to focus in school and will probably work for the duration of his/her life. For that child's ENTIRE life, he/she will think, "Was I the reason we had to live in a tiny apartment and live off of welfare?"All of this said, please explain to me how it is okay for a child to have nothing to wear or eat and have a terribly guilty conscience over something that isn't his/her fault as long as we aren't getting rid of lives.
Secondly, we tackle the situation of the stereotypical woman who "doesn't care about her child and just wants it sucked out ASAP." Yes, birth control could have been used (even though it DOES fail). Yes, it was irresponsible. The best rebuttal to this is "Shoulda, woulda, coulda." What's done is done; a woman is now pregnant. Now what do we do; shun her from society and disallow her from legally having her child aborted? First of all, illegal abortions would increase at a substantially accelerated rate which would be unsafe to both the child AND the woman; however, staying more focused on the main point, if we deem it as wrong, what will she do?
Scenario A: Give it up for adoption
Scenario B: Do something drastic(as earlier mentioned)
Scenario A: Children in adoption centers is a horrible thing to think about. While you MAY think that it's a beautiful sunshine-y rainbow unicorn glitterfest, it's actually one of the farthest things from that. Adopting children at adoption agencies is like, as sad as it is to say, ALMOST identical to adopting a puppy from a pet store; cutest and youngest ones are gone first. Basically what I'm saying is that if this kid is not the cutest thing in the world or young or doesn't have some kind of super talent, his/her chances of adoption are significantly low. Then this poor kid has to spend his/her entire childhood in a foster home, bouncing from home to home. That is not a fair situation for the child, and there is absolutely no strong oppositional point that I have ever seen to this.
Now, what if the mother has a steady relationship with her partner, but is supposed to have a child with mental, physical, and/or genetic issues? Is this mother supposed to suck it up and give birth to it anyway, because it'd inhumane to not do so? Absolutely not. Unaware if you know this, but not all families have millions of dollars they can spend; paying to help correct these issues will essentially suck these families' savings dry, and that's if they have any money to BEGIN with. Some may say that it's cold-hearted to "get rid" of a child just because something will be "wrong" with him/her, but if a child has to suffer and then die not long after his/her entrance to this world, why should that mother give birth to him/her? There will be so much more pain for that child to have to be constantly sick (for years possibly) until finally dying and not knowing what it's like to be really happy and carefree than for a mother to just terminate her pregnancy early to save him/her from that illness.

4277,abortion,""Once concieved, abortion is technically murdering the baby. It may not be out of the womb, but it is still living and breathing."
This statement makes three assumptions:
1. An unborn child is still a baby.
This is simply not true. Biologically speaking, there is a vast difference between a fetus and a baby, the most obvious one being a physical separation from its mother. Even aside from that, there's an even greater difference between an egg that has been fertilized and a baby, which you apparently still consider a baby since you refer to the point of conception. My point is that there is simply too great a biological difference to claim that a baby and a fetus or anything that comes before one are equivalent.
2. Aborting the unborn child is murder.
This assumes that the unborn child can be classified as a living organism. Given its biological attachment to the mother and its lack of physical development, it could be argued that it is not truly a living organism until it becomes separate from its mother. To be perfectly honest, there isn't a universally accepted definition of what it means to be alive or not, especially when dealing with biological organisms. However, even if you refuse to accept the idea I proposed as true and instead propose your own argument, you must understand that your ideals cannot necessarily be applied to others without solid evidence. Without an objective argument to be made, your ideas can only be applied to yourself, leaving others to make their own decisions on the matter.
"Those who say pregnant women should have the choice dont make sense to me. In that sense, what if the affirmative's parents believed that? Then they would not even exist."
Your point being? This does not in any way detract from the proposed argument. All it does is put the proponents of the argument in a position where they would be less likely to support the rights they are arguing for. That does not necessarily mean the rights they are arguing for are wrong; all it means is that the proponents could possibly be hypocrites.",3,0,Yay

1445,abortion,"They have cutoff dates for abortions, correct me if i am wrong, in around the sixth moth period. I am neither pro life or pro choice but i have some arguments that are valid.
You say that a baby is a baby at conception? I have heard so many people say that, only to find out they use the morning after pill. Is the fetus only alive after the 6 days it takes for a test to come up positive? the morning after pill is like having chance for an abortion every time you take it. everyone who has had to take it has probably had a few abortions themselves.
People who are pro choice often say that the mothers are miseducated, but the doctors explain exactly what is going to happen to every single pregnant woman who walks in. they know what they are doing, and have made their own decision. I agree that the father has equal right to decide, but what if one wants an abortion and the other doesn't? What then?

Is it better to let something enter our world when you KNOW the circumstances are not right? Is it better to let something enter the world when you know it isn't going to lead a proper life? Wouldn't it be better to stop it from entering the world? It is only when the parents are financially well, emotionally and psychologically prepared that it must be gone forward with. Otherwise, all you would do is increase the pain and suffering the world is already facing. Hence, an abortion would be a better option in such cases.",3,0,Yay
4277,abortion,"1). I am afraid you are very much mistaken: a toddler is not classified as a man due to the age and physiological differences; while both can be males, the words 'toddler' and 'man' are mutually exclusive in regards to the literal meaning of each. And when I referred to a fetus relying on its mother, I was referring to the fact that were it to be separated from its mother while still in the fetal state, it would likely not survive due to it not being developed enough to exist as a separate living organism. I agree that both a baby and a fetus are dependent on a parental figure; however, the reasons for this dependence are very different. A good way of understanding the difference I am speaking of is this: if a mother were to die, her baby would not immediately begin to die along with her, where as a fetus would due to the mother and the fetus being physically linked. I apologize if I had not made that clear, and I can go into greater detail if you feel I am still being vague.
2). First, I never referred to the fetus as "a flea that sucks off a dog's blood to survive", and I would very much like it if you did not misrepresent my argument. Second, I said quite clearly that there is no universal definition of 'living'; I was playing the devil's advocate and proposing a definition that opposed your own, and then pointing out how some people accept that definition, and that there is nothing objective that makes your definition better than theirs due to a lack of a universally accepted specific definition of what is a living organism. Once again, I apologize if I hadn't made this clear. Third, I have to once again point out that you are equating two very different kinds of dependencies: a grown man needs things like food and water to survive, but will not immediately begin to expire if they weren't exposed to these things 24/7; a fetus will immediately begin to expire if it were to be unexposed to its mother, or if its mother were to die (this is assuming that we are still discussing a fetus that is a significant amount of time away from birth; the closer you get to birth, the greater number of differences between the odds of any two fetuses surviving).

5046,abortion,"First off, please fix your grammar. Your point is very hard to read. I'm actually not sure if you're trolling or not. I'm hoping you are just trolling.
If you're not then; yeah, the doctors tell them that abortion is the best option because it's true. A fifteen year old cannot raise a child, easy as that. Yeah, there are some cases where it works out. But most of the time it doesn't and the child is not raised properly.
Women will always get abortions; that will never change. Women will go to sketchy back-alleys for abortions if that's what it takes. Back when abortion was illegal, that's what women did. Do you know how many women died? To this day 70,000 women die a year because of illegal abortions.
A fetus is unable to have any type of thinking until around 8 months in utero. Even then, it's very low-level thinking.
Some women will regret having an abortion, but it's still their choice. It's better to have an abortion then to raise a child in Hell for 18 years.

4296,abortion,"I think you make the mistake of not arguing barker's assertion. If the fetus is a human then it being ''their decision. not yours'' becomes irrelevant as it would then be murder, not abortion.
As a side note, it's a surprisingly small share of abortions which occur because the mother's life was in jail-- 5%.
I find the question of when human life begins central to the abortion debate, far superseding questions of ''privacy'' and the woman's right to self-determination. Take a fetus one day pre scheduled birth, while not out of the womb, I find it relatively uncontroversial that this viable fetus should not be afforded standard human rights. Walking it back, we eventually reach the point of partial viability, a couple months before birth, and still I think we should defer to the child rather than its mother. Going back further, we then reach no viability, not that this point isn't constantly regressing, but it seems a more reasonable proxy for human beginnings with the caveat that it would and should shift as prenatal technology becomes more robust.

How many of these babies are having their lives taken. Due to woman not wanting their baby. Be it one night stand, bad relationships , unplanned pregnancy, job worries, education or they just don't want a change in lifestyle. I say this knowing 4 women who have had abortions due to pressure from boyfriends. They have told their boyfriend they are pregnant and the boyfriend has told them to get rid of it. No really they have just turned round and told them to get rid of it. This was the words one used. But all of these four women have gone on to regret it and live with guilt of the baby they have had killed.

Do you support laws mandating seat belts? Taxes on cigarettes? Where do you fall on capital punishment? Better yet, do you support the individual mandate for health insurance? These would all be similar instances of it being ''their decision, not yours''.
To reiterate, the point I made is that IF the fetus is a human then your argument is moot. I'll also ask the question, do you support abortion rights for pregnancies only one day from delivery? Going further, some pro-choice advocates have even suggested that abortion rights could extend until the post-birth "fetus" is up to one year old. Would you support this practice?
Your argument is a cop out, tolerating an environment of complete permissiveness because it's easier. You need an actual criterion.

4227,abortion,"Has anyone given thought to this...... If a woman is murdered while pregnant, then the murderer can be charged with 2 that's right.. 2 murders. One of the mother and of the unborn child. If this is the case, how is it any different if the one making the decision to take the life is the mother rather than a murderer that kills the unborn baby with the mother? You can't have it both ways. If you take a life, unless it is in self defense, it is deemed murder.",3,0,No
4227,abortion,"So my question to you, is what is considered human? Someone that breathes, feels pain, can make voluntary movements, can hear, and see? If so, you are describing a fetus at 12 weeks.So I suppose under your train of thought that a partial birth abortion is ok as well considering the baby has not yet left the womb. It's amazing to me how pro-choice people can justify taking away the life of something just because you can't see it. Do you honestly think that a baby cannot think, or feel pain until it is outside of the womb? AMAZING! Before I was nothing, and now since I'm outside of a womb, I can do all of these things! Like magic! I guess the taking of a life is easy when you don't have to see it or do it yourself. Out of sight, out of mind. Did you know that most women who have abortions experience severe depression and feelings of guilt after the procedure? Your arguement at thispoint makes no sense. I've had surgery and never felt guilty about my tonsils taken away. Most people nor doctors for that matter would preform a surgery that would intentionally take the life of their patients. And why do you think doctors pay massive amounts of money each year for malpractice insurance? Because they ARE sued all the time for making mistakes and errors in judgement. And to your other arguement, babiees that are born premature very often grow up to have normal, healthy lives. So would it still be ok, if a mother were to go to have an abortion, only to have a premature baby and then kill it because she felt in wouldn't survive outside of the womb? This is a matter of choice. Unfortunately, because they cannot speak, an unborn child can't voice thier opinion. I'm sure given the options, they would choose not to die.",3,0,No
4227,abortion,"I'm sure the baby doesn't decide . And it is their body that is being destroyed, not the mothers. And notice nobody mentions the fathers opinion.

And let's flip the coin, if a mother has the child and the father desen't want it, he still has no choice but to pay child support. Once again , men have no choice in the matter. I'm starting to wonder if anyone is considering that this is a matter of life and death, or is this just a power struggle? It's my body, I'll do what I want with it! Ok then.... I guess you also believe that we should legalize heroin and PCP because it is your body you are ruining. And 4 year olds should get tattoos and drink whiskey because it is THEIR bodyot yours!

4227,abortion,"Fisrt of all, I never said talk... babies of course have not mastered any languages yet. My point is that a unborn baby (unless handicaped) can hear, feel ( nerve endings which include pain sensors which are developed by 9 weeks) are qualities of most humans which are already born. 2nd point... You may know what the concept of death is, but I'm sure you have no more idea what happens at death more than an unborn child. No, I do not remember what is what like in the womb. I also do not remember what being 9 months old is like... do you? Do you remember yor first drink of water? I'm sure you don't but just because you do not remember it doesen't mean it didn't happen or that if you were punched, you wouldn't have felt pain. Therefore , you cannot say with any proof that a fetus does not know it is being aborted. Check the science. If you have a nervous system, you can feel pain, whether or not you hear a scream, if you have active nerves, you feel pain. As for your arguement about not being able to handle the baby, I'm quite sure that many mothers could not handle the pressures of being a mother either emotionally, financially, or on a mature enough level. There are also thousands of families that cannot have children that would love to adopt, care for, and give the child a fullfilling life. As far as the doctors arguement , you have me a little lost. If a doctor makes a potentially fatal mistake during a routine operation, you feel that the patient or the patients family has no right to sue? Doctors make mistakes all the time, leaving surgical tools in people, leaving sponges in people causing infections, extreme pain, possible gangrene that can lead to death. I'm not sure of your arguement here.Please elaborate. Your final arguement disturbes me the most. Your arguement is that abortion should be allowd if the baby might be or is hadicaped, has HIV ( which by the way many people live relatively normal lives with ... medicine has come a long way) or any ther affliction that would not make them "normal" . I only know of one other person in history that set to destroy the handicapped, retarted, sickly, and "not normal". His name was Adolf Hitler. I personally believe that people that are handicaped , retarted, with Down's syndrome, are sick ,or have any disease have just as much right to a life as you and I. To think different in my opinion is a scary notion. Are you suggesting that a woman who is pregnant knowing that her baby has a disease should abort it? Take a look at Stephen Hawking. The man has MS and is considered by many to be the smartest man alive. Through him, we have learned much about the Universe we never knew before. Would we have done the world a favor if his mother knew he would have had MS later in life and aborted him? Look at what we would have missed out on. Albert Einstein has Asberger's Syndrome, a type of Autism... Should he have been aborted too because he wasn't "normal"?",3,0,No
4227,abortion,"You have made no counter arguement about what was mentioned about how a father has no say so in the life or death of his baby.

You are absolutely right. I do not know you, and can only go by what you say. A blanketed statement ( that pro-choice people love to over use) is that its their body, their choice. This is all that you really wrote without going in depth. I never said that you believed in legalizing PCP or heroin, I said I guess you believe it should be legalized only because of the broad statement which amounted to it'sa womans body, none of your buisness. Since the war on drugs is supposedly because we do not want Americans dying from using drugs, and your standpoint was its our bodies, our buisness, it is a pretty easy conclusion that you feel that nobody should interfere with what you do to your own body, nobody should make something you do to yourself illegal.

I would be very interested in seeing how many other pro-choice advocates feel this way. And even though this pregnancy could not take place without a fathers sperm , he still has no rights whatsoever? Interesting. But the baby is outside of the mother, and now he still has no rights. Sounds like the baby and father get the bad end of the deal. This is starting to now even more than ever sound like a power trip than someones rights. Let me ask you this...

If the one of the major deciding factors is whether there is life or not, I find the question to be quite revelant. I hate to tell you, but many states ( including the one I live in ) will charge a person with two murders in the scenario I gave earlier. Thay being the case, it raises the question how one death can be considered murder, and another nothing more than a choice. Do you also feel that a baby that is just a few days away from birth would not be able to live outside the womb, or feel pain? I truly that even most pro-choice people would agree that partial birth abortions are out and out wrong. Let me ask yet another question. What is the difference between a baby 2 days from birth and a baby that is just born? How can you justify such a difference in law just because one is in a body and one is just out of one?

Ask any gynocologist if there is a life in a woman who is 8 months pregnant , and they will say yes., There is a life in there. Life does not spontaneously begin when it is outside of a womb. But screw it right? It cant argue that it is a life. It cant tell you how it feels about being aborted. Makes it easier to make that decision when you don't have the person whos life being taken away can argue with you. According to some people here, a child has no rights until they see the light of day. Meaning that technically a woman should be able to take a life even while giving birth if that is her "decision". As long as it is not outside her body. All this in the name of "rights"? I think you confuse the word religion with the word morals. You don't have to have religion to have morals.

I noticed that nobody has touched the subject of partial birth abortions as I believe even most pro- abortionists stay clear of this subject. If there wasn't a dead baby coming out of a womb, it would only be a matter of it being a womans choice. However, seeing that abortion is by definition the termination of pregnancy, there is more than one life involved. I would recomend that you watch a film from the 80's entitled "The silent scream". It can be found on youtube. Clearly there is life in a womb. Taking an innocent persons life is called homicide or murder. You can try to justify and make yourself feel better by calling it a matter of one persons rights over anothers, but when you see the evidence, it is a legalized form of homicide.

In my case, I believe life begins at conception and I would find abortion morally wrong, because I see conception as the beginning of life and to me, terminating a baby would feel like murdering a visible person, but different in some ways such as if I were a woman that it would kill part of you along with it, the fact that you could have loved this baby if it was born.

2815,abortion,"The choice to abort or not should be legal, because women should have this right to determine what happens to their bodies. The ethical and moral choice is also theirs to make. Others should not be allowed to force choices based on their opinion or belief.
There are other viable choices that one can choose to abortion. One can carry the child to term, and adopt the baby out. The Birth Mother is given the opportunity to choose "forever families" for the baby. The government does not pay any portion regarding this baby's birth. All finances for Birth Mother,(care, prenatal care, birthing, hospital etc) are paid for by the adopting family.
AGAIN, Legality of abortion is an ethical and moral choice that belongs ONLY to the Birth Mother. What YOU choose to believe regarding abortion is directly proportionate to YOUR opinion both ethically and morally, and should not have any bearing on the ethical or moral choice of the Birth Mother.
A baby is not the problem, even if Rape is at fault. The consequence of Rape can be pregnancy and is definitely a crisis situation for the Birth Mother. However, the mind is a strange thing. One cannot understand, how one of the consequences of rape, could be carried for nine months without hatred or prejudice, BUT I can promise you, (having worked with Crisis Pregnancies up close and personal for over twenty years,) Birth Moms are amazing, and with the right environment and care, babies under these circumstances are born daily, and Mom goes through the process the same way every woman goes through it. Mom comes out on the other side of the nine months probably in better psychological health than you are right now. The key with crisis pregnancies is they must be handled with proper residential, physical, mental, emotional, educational care.
I personally do not believe in abortion, but the legality of the question is that abortion is not my choice. The choice is Birth Mom's; should remain a legal choice, and Mom MUST NOT be placed in stressful situations just to appease someone else's beliefs or choices. Again not MY choice or belief, but I will defend her choice to decide.
For those who do not know me, I have helped teen girls and fellows making this choice for a long time. My agency has over forty eight babies adopted into "forever families," and I have also worked with Baby Moms and Dads that have chosen to keep their babies and are now parenting them. We also have successful single parenting cases, that are working just fine. None of these families are on government assistance, and all are now responsible members of their communities. These results are because they were given second chances to learn, train, and meet their new goals. Our adopted babies are all healthy and living in their "forever families", without incident.",3,0,"Abortion should be legal"

2815,abortion,"Elliot:
As a matter of fact, I own a teen maternity home. Also in my State, I serve in my community as a Guardian ad litem. For the most part I speak on behalf of those that cannot speak for themselves. This includes any child under the age of majority, and in some instances on behalf of the welfare of the unborn. This happens when someone petitions the court because an under age Mom is electing to abort her unborn child. This is usually either the underage Dad or the Grandparents that do not agree with the decision and they are trying to get the judge and the court to rule in their favor. So at least in my State, I would not agree that the court would not appoint someone to act on their behalf. I believe every State has this type service, but cannot say this is so. If your State does not have this service, perhaps you can be the voice that introduces it. After talking to a lot of people, and doing much research,(called "due diligence") the Guardian presents finding to the court so that a judgment regarding welfare can be made. There are many factors involved and the court does not rule on whether a child will live or die. The decision is based on the mental status, knowledge, and understanding of the person seeking to abort. Questions like who will care for, be responsible, and what the circumstances are for seeking the procedure. Right now it costs about $20,000. 00 (rounded up) a year to raise a child. Then there is the amount to care for the Mom to be able to sustain both herself and a child. This is only one area that the court looks at. They also take mental capability, and at any medical aspects that uphold the abortion. They also take the Dad, or Grandparents, or whomever is petitioning the court into consideration. What the motivation for the petition, plus so much more. The underlying reasoning is why someone is taking away a Mother's right for her body is also looked at. A petition is not treated lightly, and consideration for the unborn child is also a factor. So, abortion is not a cut and dried decision. When someone petitions a court, it is handled with care and family court uses the Department of Children and Families for their input as well. The problem arises because not many people petition the court, but rather try to handle it themselves. Then you have families fighting, frustrated Dads because no one wants to listen to him, and then of course the Mom who is trying to make the best decision for herself, (not always the right one,) but instead is stressed to the max by everyone trying to persuade her with their input. Outside entities resort to assigning guilt for her decisions, or making her life miserable because Mom tries to shut down and shut out those folks that know exactly what she should do or how she should feel.
As I have said before, and will continue to say; There are many alternatives to abortion." If a Mom facing life or abortion makes a decision that does not agree with your opinion, instead of condemnation, try looking at her reasoning. Is abortion right or wrong? Each person must decide for themselves. Personally for me, I do not agree with abortion but I do believe in the right of choice. I did not always think this way, and it took me many years to get to the place where I am now. The reason I now believe in a maternity home atmosphere is to allow a place where stress is minimal, and allows people a safe place to learn about alternative choices. We offer other things necessary to successful independent living, and for those that decide to keep their child, education, on the job training and assistance from a living support coach to help with other factors that are some of the underlying reason's for a Mom's choice.",3,0,"Abortion should be legal"

People go to jail for neglabal homicide, its not murder because it was not with malitious intent, it was an accident.
