270;abortion;"Those of you who believe that abortion should be outlawed, consider this - In the 70's(I believe, don't hold me to the date), there were thousands of women that got pregnant each year in the US that decided to have an abortion. Since abortion was not legal at this time, many women would go to an illegal clinic where the doctors were untrained. This lead to many women dying from the injection that was meant only to kill the baby. If these women did not choose to have an abortion through one of these illegal clinics, or even sometimes if they did, they would pierce themselves with a wire coat hanger or other things to that effect to kill the baby. Many times this lead to infection and as these women were afraid to tell anyone what they did, they often died instead of getting medical attention. Therefore, in conclusion, many women lost their lives over abortions and, with abortion legal, many lives have been saved. Therefore, the weight of death would (in theory) equal the weight of life. If abortion were outlawed, it would only increase the death and crime rates as illegal clinics were reestablished and pregnant women would become infected from puncture wounds and die.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

586;abortion;"The rape scenario actually occurs a lot. About 33% of women in this country have some encounter of being sexually assaulted before the age of 18. Being assaulted once raises the chances you'll get assaulted again later. Assault meaning any form of sexual violence against a woman, not necessarily including sex. So it does occur. The same people, though, that are pro-like are usually against contraceptive drugs. Walmart, for example, didn't (until recently) hand out the abortion pill...so how are women to get their hands on these vital drugs? Abortion pill is also not really technically correct as it doesn't cause abortion just prevents conception. There are quite a few circumstances in which women find themselves in a Christian based hospital after being raped, but they refuse to hand out these emergency measures. Secondly, its no one else's business!! If you think someone is sinning...its not up to you to judge them. If they really are, God will judge them when their time comes. No one else can do that. We can't presume to know what God thinks of our actions and if we're going to heaven or hell. The Bible, the Torah, the Quran...these are historical books. I believe in the Quran, but you do have to look at it as a historical record of events as well. None of these books should be taken strictly as they are written. They have ALL been edited to suit the audience at the time. For example, some guy in the 12th century, I think, didn't like the version of the angry God as he was being depicted at the time and cut all that stuff out. That is how Christianity comes up with the notion of a loving, merciful, giving God. Editing! We can make our own decisions and no government body or religious group should determine what to do with our health.

"any act which eliminates said life is by definition murderous " This is also false. Even if one subscribes to the insane belief that something the size of a grain of salt is the moral equivalent of a walking, talking child then there is such a thing as killing in self-defence. Pregnancy and childbirth is extremely dangerous and abortion is about 10 times less likely to result result in the death of the woman.

For a child to have to grow with his parents always regarding him with even the smallest bit of ire for having been forced to birth him - I can imagine no greater hell. For a mind to evolve and come into conciousness instantly damned by the title "mistake", why do we want to subject people to this? Leave parenting to the responsible and the capable. Give the people who couldn't afford to give a child a good home or the love they need to devop properly a chance to better themselves first. Some people will never want children, but everyone deserves the right to have the time to make their lives habitable for a child. Some people make mistakes. Other people try to be responsible but something goes wrong. Regardless, it is not the parent you are punishing by forcing them to have a child - never so much as you are punishing the child. And if someone wants an abortion, they will get one. Hundreds of thousands of years of human exsistence and we still haven't learned that if we really want something, we get it.

Maybe he has decided that he doesn't have the right farming skills to nurture these apple seeds into full grown apples? I'd rather him realize that before he messed up some perfectly good apples. It is a mature decision to leave raising apples to people who are better apple farmers.

826;abortion;"I am always interested in the beliefs of someone who makes the glib comment of "I choose life". Ok, so what are your parameters? First you need to define life, then define what it means to choose it. Are we saying that you believe that all life is sacred and nothing should ever be done to cease life? If so, are you a vegetarian? Certainly killing an animal is taking life. Of course so is picking a head of lettuce, so I would guess that even eating veggies is taking life. At the extreme end, bacteria are life forms too, so antibiotics are pretty bad, as is antibac cleaner. Of course no one actually means that they believe that ALL life is sacred and needs special protection. That was just to illustrate the need to define the problem. So, perhaps the more accurate statement would be, I think all HUMAN life is sacred and should be protected. Tough call to make...doesn't that necessitate that anyone who is pro life is also staunchly anti-war?...as it supports killing. So, that causes something of a disconnect for those who think that war can even SOMETIMES be justified, if they think abortion should never be. What about those who really are pacifists...they have a better leg to stand on at least. We still have to define though, when human life begins. What data do you have to back up that the split second between a sperm and an egg existing separately, for a very short period of time, is ok to not preserve and the fertilized egg suddenly becoming mandated to preserve? Guys probably "kill" a lot of sperm over their lives, women "kill" an egg every time they do not make an effort to fertilize it....sperm and egg are both cells. What separates those single cells from the single cell created by their union? Some are opposed to abortion beyond a certain point. This becomes a much more defensible position, though still a little tough. It is hard to handle the thought of terminating the life of something that looks very close to being human, moreso if that organism has developed to the point where it can actually feel pain.

1836;abortion;"Forcing women to become mothers is a strictly misogynist view. Also, blaming women entirely for the act of bringing a baby into the world is completely backwards. It takes two, and if a woman believes that the man who impregnated her will be irresponsible, or abusive, or resent her for having the baby—why do you expect her to take up all the responsibility for herself? The government does not provide enough help for single mothers and the majority of the country looks down on them as being leeches on the state. Most of the anti-abortion rhetoric revolves around women being irresponsible and messy in their contraception practices, which is sometimes the case, but, like I said, it takes two to conceive. If a man convinces a woman that the pull-out method is safe and that he’ll be careful, she’s not being stupid. She’s being trusting. And sometimes (a lot of times) that doesn’t work out. Pregnancy is an incredibly expensive, unstable, and physiologically damaging affair. Women should have the option to not put their bodies through it. My own mother was adopted and she remains pro-choice as it is an individual’s decision as to whether or not they want to put their bodies through that. If you see a child as a “punishment” for irresponsible actions, you are not pro-life. You’re anti-women. Plain and simple.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

255;abortion;"1. There is MORE than a 1% chance that a condom and/or birth control fails. Condoms can slip off (for those guys who think they're larger than they are), bust, and tear if the wrong lubricants are used (ky jelly, crisco, anything else with petroleum). And the wrong lubricants are often used, because not everyone has proper education about using condoms, especially not young teens who are now having sex more now than ever. And condoms are the "safest" of all safe sex or birth control methods. 2. The psychological trauma of having to go through a 9 month pregnancy and then A LIFETIME of being a parent (because hello, fathers of unwanted babies are traumatized too) is most definitely going to be more than the psychological trauma of NOT having an UNWANTED child. People feel guilt for aborting children that they don't want, and that's because of the religious and moral values pushed on them from their social environment. They'll get over that much sooner than they would get over being forced to nurture a child they didn't want. Parents who planned their children often find it much harder to raise children than they originally thought and end up making incredible mistakes that negatively impact their children's lives. How good of a parent can you be if you don't even want the child? 3. The "physical difference" between a child one second before delivery and one second after delivery is that BEFORE delivery, the child is depending on the mother for life and AFTER, the child is an independent being. That's a HUGE difference. If you have a cancerous tumor inside your body, would you want anyone to be able to tell you that you have no right to remove it - even when it could cause your death? If yes, then why does a fetus have more of a right to survive than a cancerous tumor? They're both made up of living cells (sometimes, the tumor is even bigger than a baby before the 3 month cut off period to have an abortion), and they both can cause death or serious health issues in many cases. 4. I just hate when men are anti-choice (yes, anti-choice because pro-choice people are not anti-life), because they won't be the ones who are ultimately affected by a woman's choice to have an abortion. Whether or not the woman has a baby, the father can ditch responsibility and never be heard from again, leaving the woman to raise the baby alone. (And you know how much we all just LOVE and APPRECIATE single mothers!) Also, it's illegal in some places for a mother to leave her baby somewhere, but they rarely charge the fathers because THEY CAN'T BE FOUND! Negligent fathers who ditched the woman AND the baby 9 months ago are rarely held accountable. The police go looking for the baby's MOTHER. So if the mother is held more accountable for ditching her baby, then she should also have more say over whether or not to have a baby. 5. You mentioned adoption as an alternative to having an abortion. So you recommend a woman carrying a baby inside her for 9 months, THEN GIVING IT UP as LESS psychological trauma than having an abortion BEFORE the living cell is a fully developed baby?

I was once told that should this become an ammendment, that there would be shades of grey associated with life or death situations.

Shall we start imprisoning pregnant women if we don't trust them, or should we condemn the child to a lifetime of the painful and crippling side effects of their mothers' choices? Isn't the mother responsible for putting the future baby's life at risk--or does it only count if there is actually a miscarriage or a stillbirth? For that matter, shouldn't we be investigating miscarriages and stillbirths more closely? You never know, maybe the mother did something harmful to the pregnancy. If abortion is murder, then that should at least be negligent homicide. The fact is that until a living, breathing baby is born, every last thing a woman does impacts the health of the eventual baby.

He is the one that first introduced the farmer and his apple seed as a metaphor for abortion. I just kept going with it. :) As for the orphanages, improving orphanages and making abortion legal are not mutually exclusive. You can do both at the same time. My point in bringing up orphanages is that some pro-choice opponents argue that women should give their children up for adoption instead of having an abortion. There are many children who never get adopted because they have the wrong color, age, health condition, etc. When adoption is mentioned as an alternative to abortion, it is assumed that the child will immediately be adopted which is often not the case. They end up staying in orphanages or foster homes where a lot of mistreatment occurs. And who wants to give up their child to a life that is WORSE than the one they can provide for them? Personally, that would stay on my conscience longer than an abortion would. I agree with you that people SHOULD grow up and take responsibility when they have children, but that is not reality. Simply having a child does not automatically make someone mature and responsible, especially if they resent having the child in the first place. And I disagree with you that "very few people of any sort of caliber will regret the experience and love of raising a child once it's all said and done." I know several people (both men and women) who STILL resent having children that they didn't plan. They don't say it explicitly because that would be frowned upon, but their actions say it every day in their subtle or obvious neglect, lack of total commitment to being a parent, etc. For example, one man I know is married and is a great father to his oldest son, but he resents that his wife purposely got pregnant with their second son even after they both AGREED not to have anymore children. They made plans to finish raising their oldest son and then travel together. However, his wife changed her mind without telling him. To this day, seven years after his youngest son was born, he has yet to mention his son's name. Does this mean that he is not a person of "caliber"? No. He's a nice, responsible, loving father for the most part...but he definitely isn't as involved with his 2nd son as much. Is it his fault that he didn't want the second child? No. I'm not even sure if that is a conscious decision on his part, either. Still, don't you think his youngest son realizes this and is negatively affected?

It's not murder to kill a tree, and at this point the baby is just as thoughtful as a tree. (2) In courts, it would not be ruled double murder or manslaughter, since the court sees the fetus as too young to think (3) There are no brainwaves, and thus no thought. This is really what it boils down to. The fact that the fetus is not alive or sentient makes it not murder to abort it. We must act reasonably in this, and the way to do such is to look at the facts as presented thus.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

1817;abortion;"B.S. I would like to see one good statistic (from a reliable source) supporting this statement. I find this to be a very ill-informed conjecture, for several reasons. 1) It seems to me that the large majority (or all) child-abuse situations stem from deep pschylogical issues and emotional problems often rooted in past trauma and/or substance abuse. They have little to do with rational conflict/feelings between the child and parent. Rather, they are outward manifestations of inner anger from other sources. Therefore, this really has nothing to do with abortion (in most cases anyways). 2) This is based on the false assumption that most women want abortions because they hate or are angry at the baby. This of course is ridiculous, the baby has done nothing. I think it would be generally acceptable to say that most mothers want abortions out of fear or undesire to assume the responsibilities of motherhood. The only exception to this that I can think of is the occasional possibility of raped woman's anger being projected onto the baby. But even this I think can be in most cases resolved through therapy and most of all through raising the child and coming to love him/her as parenthood takes over. 3) Even if said anger/hate and potential abuse tendencies are present in the woman, I feel that the proper solution is for her to learn to improve the quality of her character and emotional stability (thereby improving her life eventually) rather than further degrade her character through murder. At the very least, if she feels she cannot do this, she should let the child be adopted into a family that can love him/her properly.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice
1817;abortion;"Of course the two aren't mutually exclusive, whether abortion is made illegal or not, orphanages should still be improved. My point is simply that the problem of "bad" orphanages shouldn't become an excuse for murder. If you have a bad problem you should fix it with good, not more bad. For those that do stay in the orphanages, I think of course that it is better for them to live in normal families, but I believe with proper care many can still be raised in a positive, healthy enviroment. As for those that are mistreated, I do not doubt that there are many. However, I do doubt that they make up the majority, in modern countries (especially the U.S.) at least. Even then I honestly do believe it is better to have lived than never to have lived at all. My personal opinion is that life is a profound thing that goes deeper than basic "good" or "bad" experiences. It consists of something greater. Regardless, I return to my more solidly-based idea that, as a matter of moral principle, murder should not be the solution to difficult problems. As far as the parents thing goes: You make some very solid points, and really, I agree with you. For those who don't mature (although I do believe many will) it is indeed bad for the child and his/her development, and in fact, it's tragic. However, I stand by my points that 1) murder is not a solution and 2) It is better to have a bad upbringing and childhood than to never be born and therefore to never experience good in contrast to the bad.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

That is a slippery slope argument. That's like saying "If you believe that someone should be able to steal food because he is dying of starvation, then the logical conclusion of that argument is that you must also believe someone can kill someone because they're dying of starvation." That's comparing apples and...paper. And it's putting arguments in my mouth that I did not make. Second of all, you agreed with a misinterpretation of my statement about "it is a mature decision to leave raising apples to people who are better apple farmers" as being a pro-adoption argument. That statement I made is an argument for people not having the child to begin with, not giving up the child after it is born. So I don't know if you will still agree with me on that. :) In your rebuttal, I'm noticing that you are taking my statements and then extrapolating a bit too much. You took my statement of not bringing more unwanted children into the world and then you said: "Let me suggest a more humane alternative. Some children are adopted into loving families. Some are not. Why don't we kill all orphans six years old and older since those are not likely to get adopted. Wouldn't this be preferable to killing all of them? " Arguing by exaggeration and sarcasm doesn't make as good of a counterargument as if you would argue using a comparable analogy. NOT bringing an unwanted child in the world isn't comparable to killing all orphans six years old and older because NOT DOING SOMETHING (not having a baby) is a passive non-action while DOING SOMETHING (killing children) is an aggressive action. Again, you're arguing apples and paper. If you're going to try to make a convincing argument, I would suggest replying to what people actually say rather than an exaggeration of what they said. It would also be nice if when people are rebutting an argument that is a response to another person's argument, that people read the original argument, too. It provides more context... The real difference between pro-choice people and pro-life people is the line that is drawn where it is considered murder. Obviously, pro-choice people draw the line at three months or before birth and pro-life people draw it at....well, they don't draw a line. I sincerely hope that pro-life people are consistent with that and don't believe in capital punishment, either. Because I really find that hypocritical... Pro-choice proponents value the woman's right to choose over the baby's right to live. Simple as that. Pro-lifers like to throw in murder to muddy the debate waters and act as if people who are pro-choice have no morals and are random killers, which is simply ridiculous to me. I shouldn't have a right to tell someone else what to do with her body. Women are not simply conduits for life. They are thinking, living, breathing human beings. I don't see any pro-lifers getting this upset at dogs when they kill their young AFTER being born because they are sick and the mother knows they will not be able to survive alone. I also don't see pro-lifers getting up in arms about people KILLING HORSES just because they broke a leg. And I don't hear pro-lifers calling farmers murderers and giving up eating their eggs (CHICKEN BABIES!) or veal (LAMB BABIES!) in protest. A bunch of hypocrites. This is the kind of topic that can go on FOREVER because it's damn near impossible to convince someone to think differently about which should be valued more: the woman who's already here or the baby that has yet to be born.

1878;abortion;"Someone on the pro-life side brought up the real issue here: does life begin at conception, or at birth, or somewhere in between? It's logical that if life were to begin at conception, then abortion would be a pretty touchy issue: after all, ending a life is pretty clearly not a good thing to do in most circumstances (however, if childbirth would endanger the child or mother for medical reasons, there's still a choice to be made). A child about to be born has most of the features of a child already born, including brain function, fingerprints, everything makes a human being unique. That's a living entity, in my mind. HOWEVER, a first trimester foetus has no brain activity. It does not think, have memories, or feel any more pain than a carrot would. It may have a few features that humans have, but doctors excise cysts which have human features sometimes. A cyst is not a person, so we can say that features do not a human make. The potential for life does not begin at conception either. Women ovulate monthly for years, men produce billions of sperm. The genetic material, children that could have been, it all goes to waste on a massive scale every day because we choose not to dedicate our lives to breeding. The reason that many people argue that life begins at conception has to do with their need to set a defensible instant when life does begin: it's not about truth emerging from facts, it's about our need to define a beginning. I don't believe it's reasonable to argue that a collection of a few thousand cells, a piece of tissue which is being kept alive through the mother and cannot think, feel or remember, can be called alive. A "living person" to me means a being who can remember, who has experienced something, who is different from the cyst I referred to earlier and different from any other being conceived five minutes earlier or later, in a different womb. An analogy occurs to me, oddly enough involving kids: My niece sometimes draws pictures for me. Each picture she draws is precious, irreplaceable, something I'll treasure and look after. However, she sometimes starts on a drawing and then crumples it up and throws it away after making a few lines, and I don't feel the urge to dig through the trash for those.

1878;abortion;"Interesting set of arguments, I'd like to try to address them: First of all, that entire segment has an a priori assumption that personhood begins at conception. The author suggests that no one should accept a "pro-choicer's" definition of personhood on faith. Fine, but I don't see why we should necessarily accept his definition either. While I agree there there may be some degree of difficulty in determining when a growing foetus becomes a "person" as he defines it, I don't think that the easy definition is necessarily the right one. Constitutionally, a human being's charter rights and patrimony begin at birth. Isn't that a clear definition? I mention it for rhetorical purposes only. The references to Nazi Germany are straw man fallacies. The author is clearly trying to appeal to the reader's emotions rather than sense. I'll discuss it at length if you insist, but I think it's pretty clear that we can throw those comments out of a rational discussion. My point about the distinction between an unfeeling, unthinking collection of living cells as opposed to an unborn child: the former doesn't feel pain. It isn't aware of its existence. It has yet to affect the world of its own volition, hasn't made choices, hasn't started looking forward to anything. It won't even respond to bright light until the second trimester. In many ways it is still a part of the potential mother. While it could potentially develop into a human being, we can say the same of an UNfertilized egg. Now, I'm confining my arguments to the first trimester. Several weeks BEFORE the foetus can feel anything. During the first trimester, many pregnancies self-abort through reabsorption of the embryo, particularly when the mother is underfed. By the reasoning often presented to me, if "abortion is murder," then these mothers should be charged with manslaughter, assuming they made every effort to preserve the embryo. Discrimination isn't a crime: it just means "to see a difference." I see a difference between a truckload of lumber and a home, between a shelf of paints and a portrait. I see a difference between an agglomeration of cells and an unborn child, and for me that difference is that the child can react to stimuli (as of 8 weeks) and demonstrate rudimentary emotion (12 weeks). Data from here: http://www.spucscotland.org/education/beginningoflife/foetaldevelopment/ The fact-checking I've had time to do (limited though it may be) has changed my viewpoint somewhat, though: abortions as a form of birth control are an ugly thing. I won't support that beyond week 8, which is when the first signs of nervous activity appear. However, there are cases (such as ectopic pregnancy) where the growing baby will KILL the mother on its way out. Regrettably, at that point, there's a choice to be made on who gets to live. You can tell me the child is blameless, my answer has to be that nothing the mother did deserves the death penalty either. The mother has a life, family who know her, stories and experiences to share with the world, a person-sized place that will be left empty by her passing. I won't ever support any law that says she must die so that someone else can live, she has to make that decision herself. A final thought: criminalizing abortion doesn't stop it. It just makes it beyond regulation. History bears this out as fact: remember the stories of knitting needles, coat hangers, back-alley butchers charging $300 without anaesthetic? The best thing you can do, whichever side of the debate you're on, is to support education about birth control and make it as readily available to people as possible. Keep the unwanted pregnancy from happening and we don't have to argue about what to do about it. Given the obvious social consequences of unplanned pregnancies, the government ought to support such options and subsidize birth control instead of wondering whether they should even teach sex ed in schools. I guess, given the above, I'm not on any side of the debate any more: I don't think there's always a choice, but I certainly don't think that abortion should be illegalized... I can't really support what I see on either side of the central line, so maybe I should retire from this debate?

Here's a link: http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm For those of you who are too lazy to read, I'll give you a 'small excerpt' from the reading: I propose, then, that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. How does the argument go from here? Something like this, I take it. Every person has a right to life. So the fetus has a right to life. No doubt the mother has a right to decide what shall happen in and to her body, everyone would grant that. But surely a person's right to life is stronger and more stringent than the mother's right to decide what happens in and to her body, and so outweighs it. So the fetus may not be killed, an abortion may not be performed. It sounds plausible. But now let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, "Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you." Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says. "Tough luck. I agree. but now you've got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him."

People who refer to abortion as "convenient" and to pregnancy, childbirth, and childrearing as merely "inconvenient" insult all parents by trivializing the sheer amount of sacrifice and work they do. Parents would not consider the difficulties of bearing and raising children a mere "inconvenience." Waiting at a red light is an inconvenience. Taking a detour on a side road because of street repairs is an inconvenience. Parenting is the most difficult job a person can undertake, and doing it poorly can have devastating effects. Pro-choicers feel that parenting should only be done by people who truly wish to do so. We do not believe in forcing unwilling, unprepared people into parenthood. And besides that, if pregnancy and childbirth is just a mere "inconvenience" what are they (PLers) comparing it to? If having a condition that threatens your health and wellbeing, your abilty to go to school, do your job, pay your rent, and force you to sacrifice your entire way of life and maybe some of your dreams is considered merely "inconvenient," then what do they consider a crisis?!

1189;abortion;"Such a statement shows gross ignorance of the extreme pain and suffering most birth mothers (women who give their children up for adoption) experience. It also ignores the health risks of pregnancy. Abortion is much healthier and safer for a woman than remaining pregnant and putting the unwanted child up for adoption. There are 135,000 children currently available for adoption in the United States alone. Why can't these childless couples take in two or three kids who are already here? What's actually in demand is healthy, white newborns, preferably male. If the child is older, disabled, retarded, has fetal alcohol syndrome, or is--heaven forbid--black, it stands very little chance of being adopted. It is not necessary to bring more children into the foster care system. Right now nearly everyone else involved in an adoption makes money off of it--the agency, the lawyer, etc., all except the person who did the hardest role of all, the birth mother. She's expected to give her services for free. As one person said, "Why should I work for nine months, and then give someone else the benefit?" It makes no more sense to expect that of a pregnant woman, then of an hourly or salaried employee. And adoption is pretty much impossible for a married woman who already has all the children she wants. Imagine the trauma to them to watch their mother go through a pregnancy with a sibling of theirs, and to see her give it away, because they can't afford another child, or because she can't emotionally handle another one. It sends the message that BORN children are disposable, and is likeable to make the children she already has think, and not without justification, "If times get tough, are you going to give me/us away, too?" There are many adoptees who are pro-choice, who even though they may be glad they weren't aborted by their birth mothers, still believe adoption should be an option, not an obligation. Sadly, there are also adopted children who are abused by their adopted parents, which is another reason some pregnant women don't want to have a child "out there" whose well-being they know nothing about.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice
1189;abortion;"Of all the questions posed by lifers, possibly the dumbest has to be, "What if your mother had aborted you?" If she had, I wouldn't be here to know the difference and I wouldn't care. My mother CHOSE to have me, and I wouldn't WANT her to have given birth to me if she only did so because she was FORCED. I respect my mother too much for that, which apparently is more than the lifers can claim about theirs. Makes me wonder if some of them have been told they were nearly aborted, and if they have vapors at the very thought, and can't comprehend that the world would not have noticed their absence and would have gotten along just fine without them. I also wouldn't be here if my parents had married other partners, or if they had used birth control or abstained that night, or had conceived the previous night or the next night instead. Does that mean that it would have been wrong if they had? Of course not. I also wouldn't be here if my mother hadn't miscarried the one right before me, or if any other sperm but the one that got to the finish line first had been the winning one. In fact, maybe if I'd been aborted, my parents would have had a different child who might have been much nicer than me, but we'll never know. It's the things that happen AFTER we arrive that make us special--the treatment we get from our family and friends, our education, the lives we in all our limitations are able to touch--not the things that happen BEFORE. Other than in the case of sperm or ova that contain the blueprints for genetic anomalies, granted, each is different, but most likely, just as good as another. You are obviously not your brother or sister, obviously, but GENETICALLY, are pretty much equal. Didn't conceive this month? Fear not--next month's ovum crop will probably be just as good. Aborted a fetus? Not to worry, the one you have when you're good and ready to have a baby will be just as good, and probably better, because it's POST-BIRTH experiences will be more positive then if it had been the end result of an unwanted pregnancy. And there are probably some people who would answer the question, "Aren't you glad your mother didn't abort you?" with "No," because she died in childbirth, and the surviving family has never let them live it down since. Or they were born into an abusive family, in which case death during the fetal stage would have probably been a blessing by comparison.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

1840;abortion;"When people debate "Pro-choice vs. Pro-life," they frequently miss the crux of the argument. It is not always the debater's fault, the label "Pro-life" obscures the point that is truly being debated. I believe most people would say they are "Pro-life" in that they value human life and do not condone thoughtlessly throwing away any life. The argument, however, is not about the sanctity of life. It is about human, especially women's, rights. If one side is labeled "Pro-life," it implies that the opposing side is "Anti-life," a gross misrepresentation of the Pro-choice viewpoint. The Pro-choice movement does not encourage women to abort any child they may be impregnated with. It argues that a woman should be legally able to choose to keep her child or not, and, if she chooses not to keep her child, to have access to a safe and legal abortion*. The Anti-choice movement maintains that life begins at conception**, and thus aborting a pregnancy is killing that life. By destroying an unborn, or "preborn" baby's life, a mother is committing murder. Murder is, of course, illegal and so abortion should be illegal as well. By this reasoning, a woman should not legally "the choice to murder people without consequence"***. Indeed, if everyone was able to agree when life began and if everyone believed that abortion is fundamentally immoral, then abortion would equate to murder. By insisting that abortion is murder, however, the Anti-choice movement not only forces its specific beliefs, religious or otherwise, on slightly more than half the population of the United States, but also overlooks the entire debate of choice. Although Wigg1es, a member who argues in favor of "Pro-life," states that "abortion is murder, plain and simple"***, it does not matter in this particular debate how vehemently opposed to abortion one is unless she herself is the woman making the choice whether or not to have her child. The morality of abortion is a different argument entirely (if it is even arguable, as every individual has his or her own personal system of morality). Debating that abortions are immoral against those who are trying to protect women's privacy and safety regardless of personal beliefs is erroneous. It simply does not follow. The Anti-choice movement is founded in this logical fallacy. It attempts to defeat the efforts of the Pro-choice movement by slinging around terms like "murder" and "infanticide" without considering the opposition that exists outside the "Pro-life" coverall of morality. It blatantly ignores the realities of accidental pregnancies and women who will choose abortion whether or not it is legal and safe. I pose this question: can anyone solidly oppose a woman's right to privacy and safe treatment without looking through the lens of moral value? *"The Issues: Abortion."

Abortion Euthanasia and assisted suicide The death penalty War These things all include someone being killed against their will (which is what pro-lifers are trying to protect). Although they are different topics we all run into conflicts within ourselves. Lets take for instance war, If we support war we support people dying because they had to go overseas, realizing these people did sign up for the military on their own, with the knowledge that they could potentially go overseas and fight. They still signed up to support their country. Are we to assume that our soldiers going overseas AND their families, AND their friends are all pro choice because they obviously support their family member/ friend. Therefore they also have to support death against the one dyings will?... I dont think so. If you are a supporter of life, by all means, no matter what, no exceptions then there is no way NO WAY you can support any war. EVEN if YOUR life depended on it. This is why self education and consistency is a must have on either side . Being pro choice or pro life is more than abortion.. abortion is just the more sensitive of the topics at hand.

You as an individual can choose not to have abortions, you can choose to try and get your church to hold “family building seminars” (where young parents are taught how to budget, health information, etc), Free (or low cost) child care, counselling, etc. This way your doing something progressive rather than holding up a sign and giving people bad impressions. You can support people who choose to not have abortions, and you can also choose to support people who do have them (after all that is whats loving and thats what Jesus would do) You can petition for improved sex ed so that pregnancies can be prevented (which means that abortions can be prevented as well). You can petition for there to be members in abortion clinics who make sure that the girls are concealed and not coerced into the procedure. What you can’t do its tell people its wrong, stop it from happening, and rely on your religion for that to happen. Thats shoving your values down others throats, thats comparable to putting religion in government (which is all fine and good for people who follow the religion, but not for people who don’t.. ie. if the US had a Hindu government who said your morals and worldview were wrong, I’m pretty sure you’d be protesting your rights to be a Christian and would be offended.

912;abortion;"I’m not suggesting that you are a bigot, simply that people may misinterpret your actions as bigoted even though you think you are doing the right thing. It is correct that the bible mentions nothing about tolerance, however the bible does mention a lot about love. In specific parable of the Good Samaritan. Where an undesirable person is portrayed as a kind and good neighbour. Jesus tells you that the second greatest commandment is to love your neighbour. Offering support and help to young women who find themselves pregnant early on in life is loving. Taking away that support and being judgemental and comdemming if they choose to have an abortion is not loving. "but, if people just followed God's laws and made good choices there would be no need for abortion.” -- Assuming your referring to new testament laws, then yes they wouldn't. But heres your problem, Not everyone is a christian and recognizes these laws. Not all christians obey these laws either. "I agree that people (in general, not just christians) should petition for education concerning pregnancy” -- Not just pregnancy, but what sort of cost is associated with a child, the risks of stds, the use of contraceptives etc. "the heart is "decietfully wicked" and people do evil things.” -- So the young girl who had a poor education, and an older man professed his love for her. In her naivety she had sex with him and became pregnant. He runs off and she is stuck with being pregnant, being young, and having no way to take care of the baby or deal with the social implications and has an abortion. YOur calling her evil? your calling her wicked? This was probably not your intention, but this is how it can be interpreted "Many times the things leading a woman to get an abortion is because of evil” -- lets use the example of someone I know. A church pastor (when she was under the age of consent) professed his love for her and she was naive. They had sex, she got pregnant. He ran away. What are here repercussions if she keeps the baby? She’ll be a social outcast, the church will talk about her and scorn her, she will not be able to take care of the child because of her age, she will have to stop school to do it, she does not want to carry the child of the man who abused his power to persuade her into a relationship. We can't fight evil with more evil -- No, but you can live as an example, you can offer love and support regardless, You can be “the lights” God commands you to be rather than just a seemingly hateful voice in a crowd directed at young women who may have been abused,";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

912;abortion;"Its good to clarify. Yes the rape, incest, etc are horrible things. But these are not the only considerations during abortions. Theres the family consequences, the relationship consequences, the social consequences, the economic consequences. Not to mention the fact that pregnancy is not pleasant and can have medical consequences. Theres also the time it is going to take. It will change your whole life. Adoption only deals with some of the economic factors. There will be tons of emotional damage from having to cary the baby to term and give it up. "Condoms don't protect your heart” -- some people don’t have the same standards as you do, and sex with condoms outside of marriage is seen as part of a healthy relationship. Again, this is going with the whole personal values and morals thing we spoke about. "I know a woman who had an abortion many years ago and she has regretted the decision her whole life.” -- And there is many stories like this one, there are also many stories where the woman had the child and regretted it her whole life. Jumping to try and shut it down is not constructive and will lead to suffering. Putting out resources, improving education, being respectful, being supportive, etc. These are the things that will be constructive. "I completely agree, more needs to be done to help these women who have unwanted pregnancies. But the way to help them isn't to convince them to kill thier child.” -- and suggesting that its either A) killing a child or B) forcing them to have a baby is also wrong. Pro choice is not about convincing people to kill children. Its about giving education, preventing pregnancies by use of education on contraceptives, and abstinence (While an abstinence only education is flawed, it does have merits so long as people do realize that they could mess up and have a back up plan like condoms). Pro choice is actually aimed at trying to prevent pregnancies before abortion comes up as an *option*. And it should be a very informed option with support for either choice without it being forced or made to convince the person that it is the only option";3;0;3;Pro-Choice
912;abortion;"Faith, As I see it relies on personal experience, feelings, etc rather than proof and evidence. If you want to say that your faith has evidence you have a lot of evidence to present. I have respect for the jist of what christianity teaches, I see the important cultural and historical influences (and some negative influences caused by devout, but ill gilded followers) From where I stand I do not see the evidence. "My faith is based upon the testable laws of the Lord. i.e. "Do not murder." - People don't do it... nobody gets murdered. "Love your neighbor as yourself" - People do it... nobody gets the cops called on them for parking slightly in the neighbor's driveway. If people follow God, people won't get hurt.” - I’m not sure If I understand this. You have faith because if people follow the ten commandments they don’t get hurt? How does this prove that God wrote the commandments and not men? how does it prove God? How does it account for christians who do not follow them? how does it account for people who follow them and get hurt? ... What if we switch “ten Commandments” With “Buddhist Precepts”? The Five Precepts are the basis of Buddhist morality. The first precept is to avoid killing or harming living beings. The second is to avoid stealing, the third is to avoid sexual misconduct, the fourth is to avoid lying and the fifth is to avoid alcohol and other intoxicating drugs. The evidence for the five precepts: After we have stopped doing bad, we then commence to do good. Take for example, speech. The Buddha says we should start by refraining from telling lies. After that, we should speak the truth, speak gently and politely and speak at the right time. He says: "Giving up false speech he becomes a speaker of truth, reliable, trustworthy, dependable, he does not deceive the world. Giving up malicious speech he does not repeat there what he has heard here nor does he repeat here what he has heard there in order to cause variance between people. He reconciles those who are divided and brings closer together those who are already friends. Harmony is his joy, harmony is his delight, harmony is his love, it is the motive of his speech. Giving up harsh speech his speech is blameless, pleasing to the ear, agreeable, going to the heart, urbane, liked by most. Giving up idle chatter he speaks at the right time, what is correct, to the point, about Dhamma and about discipline. He speaks words worth being treasured up, seasonable, reasonable, well defined and to the point.” - Gautama, Buddha (NOTE: I’m not a buddhist, I’m just putting this out as an example because its another religion I know a lot about)";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

Also, a study was made (search the Donohue-Levitt hypothesis) that shows that if the mother dies and the child survives, it's more likely that the child will feel unloved, and that it's the unloved children who grow up to be in gangs and street violence.

1846;abortion;""95% of abortions", you said, were "because of not being able to afford the child, getting in the way of their job, too young, want to wait, etc." And here comes the part where I put in my two cents. If the mother can't afford the child, how is its life going to be? It would grow up, live in poverty, and probably suffer. Kids are expensive these days. Would ya rather have a child have to live through suffering for years, or have it (and its mother) be spared poverty? The mother has a job, but a child would just get in the way. So if the child is born, what happens? The mother loses her job, and the kid's living in poverty. Back to the previous argument. Too young. So if the person is, in their opinion, too young, they need to be forced to have the child? You said "you make the decision of having a child at the bed". So if the woman didn't want the child, she couldn't have sex at all? No matter the protection, there's always a chance of pregnancy. You're suggesting, it seems, that if she doesn't want a child she doesn't have sex. That, to me, seems unfair on the woman. She should be let to do what she wants without being forced to unnecessary measures. Want to wait. Well, if she wants children later in life, but you force them on her now, is she still going to want them?

Besides which with/without brain waves, the fetus responds to stimuli as early as nine weeks, and later enters REM sleep, tastes, hears, etc. Thus, an abortion is the destruction of a responsive life (at least after nine weeks). Is my idea Nazi-like? Of course. But it's honest. To say that the "pro-choice" of abortion is the woman's choice is like saying that a mother can kill her 5 yr old simply because the baby came from her body. It's also like saying I can kill people and it's okay because I was exercising my choice. We would never accept that, and I don't think we should cloud the issue of abortion with misleading titles like "pro-choice" or even "pro-life." If people want to have abortions, go ahead.

With the best medical care, of course - no killing here! You say: "ok who are we too say what life deserves to live or die.That's God's descision." OK, so let God decide if the foetus is viable or not - if it will survive or not. If this is a first trimester foetus, God is likely to decide that it should not survive. If this is in the last trimester, God is likely to decide that it should survive. Middle trimester - ??? God's will, I guess (or, if you prefer, natural selection). This is a WIN-WIN scenario. The mother is not forced to be pregnant against her will - she wins. And GOD gets to make his decision as to who lives or dies - GOD wins.... Your argument leads to this as the only logical solution.

However, I MOST VEHEMENTLY disagree that the killing of a 5-year old (or near-term foetus) is comparable in any way to early term abortion. Please, remember, I do NOT approve of abortion myself...I just regard it as a 'lesser evil' than forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term - and I regard it to be an even worse evil to impose MY prejudices onto another person, instead of allowing them to make their own informed choice (and I mean TRULY informed - from all sides). I would be very interested in your ideas regarding my (described a few times above) proposal: instead of killing the foetus (abortion), why not offer the option of 'immediate delivery'? That does not force anyone to anything...and a foetus in an advanced stage of development (and thus likely sentient) would have a very high probability of survival....and there would be no direct killing of anyone... And it would be much more comparable to your (or, Asimpleman's) analogy: a 5-year-old is capable of happy survival in foster care, away from the 'birth mother'. I am proposing that when a woman no longer wishes to host the foetus, it would be delivered. If, like the 5-year-old, it is capable of survival in foster care - no harm is done, the baby will survive.

Many readers of their literature then assume that embryos can feel pain from this point in pregnancy onwards. However all available evidence shows that even though these sensors develop early in pregnancy, human embryos cannot actually sense pain. Certain major components of the central nervous system that are necessary to feel pain are not present and functioning. One can only imagine the needless pain and anxiety felt by women who believe -- on the basis of some pro-life literature -- that their embryos have suffered pain during an abortion, miscarriage, or emergency treatment for an ectopic pregnancy. Many physicians and medical researchers believe that fetuses can begin to feel pain sometime during the third trimester. This is long after: Essentially all miscarriages occur, Ectopic pregnancies have been dealt with, and After about 99% of abortions are performed. Some researchers suggest fetuses cannot sense pain, no matter how far along in pregnancy. They believe that pain can only be felt after birth.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

Or would they have to pay money as if the human life had a market value? - Banning it would only make the practice more private, and it would not teach people that abortion is wrong. It'll teach them that getting caught aborting is wrong. - It truly depends on the situation. If aborting the baby would mean saving the mother and/or child from death, then it should be the mother's choice. Also, if the child would be born in an area where it would starve or suffer, the fetus would be best left unborn. - Pro-life is usually an argument made by men who want to firm their control on women.

The embryo and the early stages of the fetus have the potential to become a developed human being, but aren't yet so. Therefore, I don't think an embryo or early fetus should get the same legal standing as the woman, who's body is what allows this fetus to develop into a ready-to-be-born baby. In response to your second paragraph, let me ask you something. Do you think any of the women getting abortions would favor allowing murder? Would they wish to allow rape, pillage or theft? Obviously not! These values you've mentioned are shared by almost everyone living in our society--these are shared values, with absolutely no controversy surrounding them. Is preventing a fetus from reaching a fully developed stage the same as going up to a stranger on the street and shooting him in the face?

Abortion really isn't a political issue, it's more of a religious/moral one. And religious bias is never a good thing to show in bias. I used to think the U.S. opposed the favoring of one religion over another, but then I realized the constitution is only a peice of paper. I oppose animal hunting, animal cruelty because of my religious/moral beliefs, but I am not pompous to the point where I would want people to lose their rights. Taking away people's rights usually opens up a bad can of worms. Ask any oppressive leader you know. Also, I would like to make the following points: 1 - What should the punishment be for practicing abortion? Nothing. The bigger the punishment, the more private the practice will be. That's why prohibition never worked and never will work. Also, you can't expect people to pay a fine for aborting their own body parts. If life was really sacred, you wouldn't be advocating to put a dollar sign on dead fetuses or take away the rights of the living. 2 - I oppose abortion. I think it's sick and irresponsible. Though, I don't have the right to force anybody to abort or not abort. Neither do you. 3 - So, you would still force the woman to carry out their pregnancy if it would threaten both her life and the child's life? 4 - You lack experience and knowledge to decide whether abortion should be illegal.

The best way to lower the abortion rate is through increased sex education in all public schools--programs that teach both abstinence and safe sex (condoms, birth control pills, etc.), not through banning or restricting the practice of abortion. As I've clearly demonstrated in one of my above posts, restrictions on abortion haven't had any visible effect whatsoever on the abortion rate, which has been steadily declining completely on its own.

You might want to supply some evidence on your timeline for development.

96;abortion;"A few points I would like to make: - If abortion would be banned, what would happen to those who practice it? Would they lose an arm or leg or would they be tossed in the oven? Or would they have to pay money as if the human life had a market value? - Banning it would only make the practice more private, and it would not teach people that abortion is wrong. It'll teach them that getting caught aborting is wrong. - It truly depends on the situation. If aborting the baby would mean saving the mother and/or child from death, then it should be the mother's choice. Also, if the child would be born in an area where it would starve or suffer (Sudan), the fetus would be best left unborn. - Pro-life is usually an argument made by men who want to firm their control on women. If you aren't carrying any babies, who should you be to decide this. This doesn't apply to you. It's like having children decide what adult benefits should be. There are three positions to abortion: 1 - All pregnant women must have an abortion, by law 2 - All pregnant women must not have an abortion, by law. 3 - All pregnant women are free to choose which they prefer. My position is #3. The only non-extremist position out of the three. I'm not left-winged or right-winged, I like to consider myself full-fledged. Abortion really isn't a political issue, it's more of a religious/moral one. And religious bias is never a good thing to show in bias. I used to think the U.S. opposed the favoring of one religion over another, but then I realized the constitution is only a peice of paper. I oppose animal hunting, animal cruelty because of my religious/moral beliefs, but I am not pompous to the point where I would want people to lose their rights. Also, I would like to make the following points: 1 - What should the punishment be for practicing abortion? Nothing. The bigger the punishment, the more private the practice will be. That's why prohibition never worked and never will work. Also, you can't expect people to pay a fine for aborting their own body parts. If life was really sacred, you wouldn't be advocating to put a dollar sign on dead fetuses or take away the rights of the living. 2 - I oppose abortion. I think it's sick and irresponsible. Though, I don't have the right to force anybody to abort or not abort. Neither do you. 3 - Most of you lack experience and knowledge to decide whether abortion should be illegal. Once you experience carrying a fetus, then you can make a fully informed decision. Roe v. Wade was decided and the right decision was made.

And those in the legal field have to abide by this ruling because to start to debate the recognition of a fetus as human or not would surely bring up religious issues which the government--by the Constitution can not make decisions based upon.

If the warnings are put out that hey back alleys are dangerous and the woman still gets one shame on her for not using common sence. Thanks Frankie for mentioning the rarities. Indeed many abortions are mainly because the "condom broke" or unprotected sex to begin with and yes there are always exceptions such as rape or liofe threatening birth, but that doesn't erase the majority of cases. And again thank you Frankie. Many women that I know are actually pro-life. But many men I know are pro-life as well including me.

422;abortion;"As in most 'abortion' debates, I would like to suggest a compromise. Abortion is the intentional killing of a foetus, then waiting for the woman's body to rid itself of it. Frankly, I do not like the idea of killing - human or potential human. However, it has been shown throughout history that 'forced childbearing' has been used to enslave women in so many societies, it is abhorrent and must never be allowed. In addition, being pregnant is a very risky physical state, physically and mentally, and nobody ought ever be forced to take such risks against their will. So, what is the compromise? Deliver the unborn child! The moment a woman refuses to host a foetus, it ought to be removed from her body. That is the only protection for women everywhere from unspeakable emotional and physical enslavement. However, there is no need to actually kill the foetus. Medical advances are allowing younger and younger premies to survive. Once a foetus is delivered live, it has all the protections of a human being. At this point, all efforts to raise it and find an adoptive family for it can begin. Thus, a woman will NOT have the right to choose to kill her potential baby. Yet, she will not be forced to host it, either. It will then be in the hands of God (and science) whether the fledling with full human rights lives or dies. If this is done during the first trimester, chances for survival are slim. Yet, second-trimester delivered babies have lived....and third trimester almost assures survival.

3799;abortion;"This is my personal take on it: Murder is a legal term, defined as the unlawful killing of one person by another, especially with premeditated malice. Abortion is legal, and even when it wasn't (between the late 19th century and 1973, or up to the late 60's depending on which state you lived in), it was never considered the moral or legal equivalent of murder. Occasionally an incompetent practitioner whose patient died after a botched abortion might have faced prosecution, but the women themselves seldom, if ever did. And it was never completely illegal, just restricted, as in having to be performed by a physician, and there were almost always exceptions for threats to the woman's life or health (which many conscientious physicians interpreted to include her mental health, i.e. threat of suicide), pregnancies caused by rape or incest, and fetal deformities. A lot of people have things that they think are, or at least are as bad as, murder. Some people think capital punishment is murder. Others describe killing animals in order to rob them of their coats, use their meat, test them in laboratories, etc. as murder. But until either the law or the dictionary changes, calling something "murder" that clearly doesn't fulfill the criteria for murder is doing nothing more then trying to re-define words to promote your own agenda, and to stir up the basest of emotions in others. Sad things is that once a person hears "abortion is murder" often enough to believe it, it's only a matter of time before an unbalanced individual decides, "If you think it's murder, ACT like it's murder," with the resulting clinic violence we're all too familiar with. More on what does and does not meet the criteria for murder: Murder-n. the killing of a human being by a sane person, with intent, malice aforethought (prior intention to kill the particular victim or anyone who gets in the way) and with no legal excuse or authority. In those clear circumstances, this is first degree murder. By statute, many states consider a killing in which there is torture, movement of the person before the killing (kidnapping) or the death of a police officer or prison guard, or it was as an incident to another crime (as during a hold-up or rape), to be first degree murder, with or without premeditation and with malice presumed. Second degree murder is such a killing without premeditation, as in the heat of passion or in a sudden quarrel or fight. Malice in second degree murder may be implied from a death due to the reckless lack of concern for the life of others (such as firing a gun into a crowd or bashing someone with any deadly weapon). Depending on the circumstances and state laws, murder in the first or second degree may be chargeable to a person who did not actually kill, but was involved in a crime with a partner who actually did the killing or someone died as the result of the crime. Example: In a liquor store stick-up in which the clerk shoots back at the hold-up man and kills a bystander, the armed robber can be convicted of at least second degree murder. A charge of murder requires that the victim must die within a year of the attack. Death of an unborn child who is "quick" (fetus is moving) can be murder, provided there was premeditation, malice and no legal authority. Thus, abortion is not murder under the law. Example: Jack Violent shoots his pregnant girlfriend, killing the fetus. Manslaughter, both voluntary and involuntary, lacks the element of malice aforethought.";3;1;3;Pro-Choice

"Pro-Lifers" focus on making abortion illegal. Let's be realistic here. This law has been here for years. Making abortion illegal will NOT END ABORTION. Yes, it may cause abortion numbers to decrease, but women will just go back to the dangerous methods they used before abortion was legal, which will result in deaths of both mothers and children. Is this really what what we want to happen? I believe the true anti-abortioner will not focus on making abortion illgeal but would rather focus on providing a comprehensive sexual education and other fundamentals that would prevent many unwanted pregnancies. Although "pro-life" sounds lovely, it is not the best we can do to truly end abortion.";3;1;3;Pro-Choice

Responsible - having a capacity for moral decisions and therefore accountable, capable of rational thought or action: The defendant is not responsible for his actions. Based on this definition, abortion is a responsible choice when confronting an unwanted pregnancy, by correcting her mistake and moving on. The kid will maybe end up in an orphanage? Let's note that adoption was considered dumping your mistake on others and irresponsible in the days before legalized abortion. Is it necessary to put more kids in the foster care system? And, most people involved in that make money off of it. "Why should I work for nine months, and then give someone else the benefit?"";3;0;3;"Yes, it should be allowed."

1267;abortion;"Actually, it's a very simple issue. Forcing a woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term is cruelty towards her, towards the baby that gets created this way, and towards society.

My Gosh...listen, buddy...it takes two to tango! The man is just as responsible for his actions, as she is for hers! Children do not come to being through immaculate conception! Are you really and truly saying that a woman should never have sex, unless she is fully prepared to have the baby...but, the man can have all the sex he wants, without having any responsibility at all? In other words...should an unwanted pregnancy occur...she MUST have the baby and LEARN HER LESSON...while he TAKES OFF, if he feels like it...no consequences to suffer, nor obligations to meet. No lessons to learn...and no remorse?! Hmmm...very interesting!!! Let me ask you...if the shoe was on the other foot...and it was the man who got pregnant...would the equation of responsibility (and lack thereof) remain the same? Would it be against the law for men to have abortions? Should he be forced to have the baby, would it simply be accepted, if the "young teenage woman" decided to evade all responsibility? The bottom line is...men do not get pregnant...and don't have women walking out on them, because they are pregnant. So, who are you to teach anyone a lesson!?";3;0;3;"Yes, it should be allowed."

Life doesn't translate to personhood, and without personhood, there can be no primary rights. The mere fact that an embryo is currently alive does not give it the right to remain so at the cost of the woman's autonomy.

Why aren't their lives "sacred"? How about keeping our own population "in check"!? Do we really need anymore unwanted children in this world to adopt? One of the main problems is that, certain religions perpetuate guilt about sex. They preach lifeways and practices that lack human understanding, wisdom, and better judgement.

Having said this, abortion is just about the worst form of birth control available. It's better than carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term, but it falls far short of simply not getting pregnant in the first place.

Let’s reverse the situation completely. For all of those people willing to give the women the benefit of their profound knowledge, wisdom and insight, I suggest we put your lives under a microscope and let us give you the benefit of our collective wisdom and from that information you will then conduct your life on our terms. Pregnancy occurs when the sperm fertilizes and egg. This is not a huge surprise and has been known for a very long time. Terminate the pregnancy or have the baby and do the best you can in raising the child. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise. It’s none of their business.

Let us also assume she had sex because she wanted to because she likes it as much as the man does. Let us assume (here comes the horror) she is an unwed woman who also enjoys sex. OMG I know, there is no end to the number of sins involved in this one. She has no interest in having a baby and discovers she is pregnant. She either will have it or she won’t have it. The answer is still the same. It’s none of your business. There is nothing terrible about giving up a child for adoption. It is simply another choice she has.

You do manage to describe sex in the most basic and wonderfully clinical terms. At the very least I would hope that you find it as much fun as the rest of us. I got married at 21 and honestly, at no point did I consider abstinence a viable option. (There were a number of promising dates who thought it was an option I should vigorously pursue but that is really another subject). I am glad you have not lost your sense of moving from the ridiculous to the absurd in a single statement. What does any of this have to do with China or forced abortions? We are talking about whether or not a woman can choose for herself. A legitimate child is a child who is born. There right to legitimacy is not predicated on your sense of morality and we are all thankful for that. The moral and ethical implications seem highly important to you and as such perhaps living your life in this way, according to your own terms, is the best thing for you. How wonderful for you never to have had a crisis of conscience. Apart from the abortion issue, you seem to have taken on the quality of life issue too. You would allow the termination of life based on a genetic difference in the child or if the mother is terminally ill. How much prescreening would you do to make this determination? If the terminally ill mother decided to have the baby I think adoption may work for that child. Please make up your mind. Are abortions ok in some cases now? Personally, I am forever happy to meet a flirtatious woman. I am way happier with them than I am with a self righteous prude of either sex.

1267;abortion;"Rape is a violaton of a person's autonomy over their body, the woman is having a penis forced into her against her will. For some rapists, this isn't enough: they actively wish to impregnate their victim because they recognize forced pregnancy as an even bigger violation. For society to aid the rapist by forcing the woman to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term is akin to raping her daily for nine months. Let me help you out with some language corrections. First, a fertilized egg is not a baby. It's not a baby when it becomes an embryo or early fetus, and it's not a baby when it gets aborted. If such a fetus is carried to term and all goes well, it will become a baby, but it would be premature to call it anything but a fetus until then.

1267;abortion;"Not at all. When someone makes an exception for rape, they're admitting that it's not really about "protecting the baby", it's about punishing the woman.

Our point, of course, is that it's the woman's choice, since it's her body that's playing the host. 1) Perhaps, like most people, she had sex for the sex. By all means, she should have used reliable contraception. However, not everyone gets real sex education and not all methods are reliable, so unwanted pregnancies still happen. I'd like for them to happen less, but we have to deal with the ones that happen now, and there's absolutely no sense to punishing the woman by forcing her to carry the unwanted pregnancy to term. This is pure misogny and you should be ashamed of yourself. I've certainly lost any respect I might have had for you. 2) These are options, and so is abortion. Let the woman choose instead of trying to force your choice on her. 3) An unborn life is the same as not a life. You don't get to round up only when it's convenient for you. 4) Population is a real issue, particularly since every American has a huge carbon footprint compared to a third-worlder.

3972;abortion;"I am in no way pro-abortion, but then again I am not against abortion. There are cases in which abortion should be acceptable. For example if a woman is raped, and gets pregnant from this, how is it fair for someone to tell them they must keep their baby, which has the DNA of someone who could be so sick as to rape someone. This baby would be a permanant reminder of that horrible night, and the mother might even neglect the baby because of it. Another point which was raised by my dad, is abortion up to 24 weeks. I DON'T agree with this. I just looked up a photo of a baby which was aborted at 24 weeks, and it made me feel physically sick. Aborting a baby at the beginning stages of the pregnancy, if there is a proper reason for it then it is acceptable, but at 24 weeks, and even before that, past 12 weeks really, it's horrible to even think about.";3;0;3;"Yes, it should be allowed."
3973;abortion;"But then why legislate against murderers or rapists? They are also the exception, and yet nobody would say it is wrong to legislate them. You regularly legislate against the exception because they are just that, the exception to the rule that needs clarification or needs to be dealt with.

2273;abortion;"Yes, I feel relatively neutral on the matter, but, if abortion by a doctor was illegal, then, we risk the chance that many women desperate not to have a baby might find riskier ways to kill the fetus.";3;0;3;"Yes, it should be allowed."
3759;abortion;"The usual claim of a "pro-lifer" is that abortion is wrong becaue a human is being killed. This is, in my opinion, not the case. A fetus is composed of human cells, but it is not a person. It has no working organs and does not have the nervous system to experience anything. If this was true of an adult human he would be pronounced dead. The fetus is also incapable of suffering due to its lack of nerves and therefore abortion is not cruel either, as some would claim. The only other reason a person might be opposed to abortion is if they wish to give every fetus a chance at life. (This claim sort of contradicts the claim that a fetus is already human, but that's not my point now.) This argument is invalid as well because you could make the same claim about any chance at conception. Every time a person is not having sexual intercourse he is denying a potential baby its right to life, so why isn't that equally wrong?";3;0;3;yes
450;abortion;"here we go again with yet another abortion-yea or nay debate I am all in favor of abortion if that is what the pregnant female wants after chatting with her loved ones, it is her final decision and should not be regulated by law I find your last condition laughable, how does one decide the income level line to have ot not have ab abortion?

(hypothetical situation)";3;0;3;yes
3654;abortion;"I believe that abortion is perfectly acceptable. It is unfair on both mother and child, and possibly father in some cases, that if a child is unwanted, why should it have to live with its parents, that may not be able to cope, because of age money abuse etc. People may say it could be given up for adoption, but it takes a long time, and agencies are very pushed for workers and money. I do not see any problem with it.";3;0;3;yes
3759;abortion;"The fetus is "alive" the whole time, but it is not a person until birth, or shortly before. In it's early stages it is more similar to a tadpole than a human. I do not think it is very kind to abort fetuses if they can feel pain, but it is no more unkind than killing, say, a fish which can feel pain just as much. So if you are not opposed to killing fish, then you can't say suffering is a reason not to abort fetuses. As for your Beethoven fallacy, my argument concerning avoiding sex being wrong adressed just this issue. You are arguing that aborting a fetus could take away the future of that child. But really, doesn't abstaining from sex do exactly the same thing? Wouldn't the world be just as deprived of Beethoven's music if his parents just didn't do it as if he was aborted? Haven't we lost just as much talent, if not more so, by not having sex? Really, your argument is completely meaningless. Also, for your information, Beethoven's parents were perfectly healthy, and he was the eldest of his siblings except for one stillborn, which was common in those days. At least try to get your facts right!";3;0;3;yes

1068;abortion;"The problem is that only one of the two people who had sex imperatively must deal with the consequences. Leaving out social pressure and mandated child support (both of which can be avoided or ignored), the man can simply walk away from the "consequences," while to the woman they are long-term, life-altering, and even potentially fatal. So although I am not in favor of it on a personal level, I see abortion as a way of making the consequences equal. If the father doesn't want to be responsible for the fetus he doesn't have to, the mother should be able to make the same decision. Life only really begins when neither of those choices are inherently fatal to the fetus.";3;0;3;yes
3759;abortion;"Yes I can compare harming a fish to harming a human being, because at that stage in its life the only similarity between the embryo and a grown human is its DNA. Why does it make sense to give certain genetic codes more rights than others? And don't say that it's because the embryo has potential to become a human, because every sperm and egg cell has the potential to become a human. Is a woman committing murder every month that she does not allow an egg to be fertilized by having sexual intercourse? And would you even think of punishing her for it? Also, you asked me to consider the fish's feelings. I'm sure the fish would not be pleased at all, but my point was that we generally don't have moral qualms about killing a fish, and that to have such qualms about killing a fetus with similar, and in fact lesser abilities than that fish is an inconsistency. If you think all living things deserve the same rights, i.e. if you are an ethical vegan, then I might be able to accept your point of view as consistent, though I would still disagree with you.";3;0;3;yes

How a person answers these questions, and thus were they stand on abortion, is bound to their ideas of religion, morality, and philosophy. Because science has no clear answers for any of these questions, and since it remains a moral, religious, and philosophical isssue, the government has no right to make a choice. The government has no right to choose any set of moral, religious, or philosophical principles over any other set. If the government were to say abortion is illegal because life begins at conception, the government would be making abortion illegal based on a belief rather then a fact, something that the government has no right to do. It comes down to a personal choice, based on personal beliefs, that only one person can make, and that is how it should be.";3;0;3;yes

In America, we have got a lot of people who are atheist, or who simply couldn't care less about religion, which is definatly is not a common viewpoint in south american countries. so america is less umm.."conservative" about these things than south america. anyway, i'm pro-choice because i really don't care what you do with your baby, kill it, eat it, stomp on it, curse it, whatever. Personally though, i could never have an abortion. I couldn't abort my child, it wouldn't feel right.";3;0;3;yes
3853;abortion;"Why? "ITS NOT RIGHT" Isn't an argument. Theres no good argument, because nobody can define when life begins, especially not scientifically. Should jerking off be illegal? You are killing babies when you do that. No, no that's not "life" jerking off should be legal. How about when the egg is fertilized. Sure that sounds good, killing a fertilized egg is murder. But if a pregnant woman loses the fertilized egg (which happens rather frequently) she would be subject to involuntary man slaughter. Right? She killed a baby, maybe not on purpose, but she killed it. She's a murderer, by definition. What your left with is a whole lot of gray about when life begins. Nobody can prove when life begins, even what life is. You may have your own beliefs about what life is and when it begins, but you can prove nothing. So if an abortion violates your beliefs or theology, dont have an abortion. Thats your own choice. But don't tell me I cant have an abortion because you think its wrong. How would you feel if there was a Hindu majority in this country trying to make eating cows illegal. Cows are just as sacred to Hindus as babies are to you, but you can't just force your own beliefs on other people.";3;0;3;yes

This is Convinceme.net, we're here to argue and debate and disagree. I respect your opinion, hell I had the same opinion for years. "My body my choice" to me was a terrible argument because it's not your body thats in question but the body of the baby. But after thinking it through I came to the conclusion that I've stated here. I, personally (if the issue ever came up) would prefer adoption to abortion, but I dont want the government making the decision for me, especially without any real good argument for doing so. But, again, I've been wishy washy about the issue for years so I wouldn't doubt that a real good argument could push me to the other side, I've just yet to see one. So give me a push. Just for the hell of it I wanted to quote an episode of the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror in which the aliens Kang and Chang are running for president: Kang: Abortions for everyone! Crowd: BOOO Kang: Abortions for no one! Crowd: BOOO Kang: Hmm. Abortions for some, tiny American flags for everyone! Crowd: YEAH! So, I can't prove that the fetus is not alive and you cant prove its alive. Thats the basis of my argument. Since we cant tell for sure what "it" is, how can the government come in and declare it a living entity which deserves legal protection. I have the same argument for brain dead people. I, personally, consider them dead when the brain is dead. But who really knows when life is over, or what life is for that matter, so how can the government come in and tell my family I'm alive and you cant let me go? Because these issues are so philosohpical in nature I argue that the government should just mind their own business and let individuals decide based on their own beliefs. Now your job is to explain to me why the government has a right to step in and declare something alive without any evidence to support the claim. So go on, Convince Me!";3;0;3;yes

There are countless examples of women who have been brutally raped, a victim of incest...and although these examples are extreme...they happen everyday. Now, you may not be able to identify with these women, but many have lost their lives attempting to get "back alley" abortions during times when it was illegal.

There will always be people who want abortions, and therefore having it legalised means it will be done in a safer manner. What really needs to be done is teaching people about contraception so that the number of teenage pregnancy's will decrease and so we will not need to abort so many foetuses.";3;0;3;yes
337;abortion;"This is a debate in itself. In brief, there are two types of rights, negative and positive rights. Roughly speaking, the former prevent action and the latter impose an obligation to act. Consider now abortion and theft. Theft is an infringement on the (negative) right to sanctity of property. By making a law against theft, one is preventing infringement by one person upon another's rights. That's easy to understand. On the other hand, a law against abortion could be either a negative or a positive right, depending upon whether one considers the fetus to be protected by the ordinary rules applying to society. If the fetus is alive, then abortion becomes an issue of murder, the right to life being a negative right. If not, then a law against abortion is a positive imposition upon the parents, infringing upon their rights rather than preventing them from infringing upon another's. As a matter of fact, the status of the fetus is in question. The default position should be that government takes no action (no action without cause). It follows that abortion is legal, except when it can be established beyond reasonable doubt that the rights of the fetus are being infringed. I have just explained the position of US jurisprudence. Their compromise is that the fetus is considered alive and entitled to rights in the third trimester. It's a reasonable compromise. Abortion is an extremely difficult issue, and to declare that it should be outright "legal" or "illegal" is to show an extreme ignorance of the complexities of the legal, philosophical and ethical issues involved.";3;0;3;yes
337;abortion;"teachme, I agree with you. I'd just like to add one thing: an early-stage fetus is alive in precisely the same sense that an appendix is alive... yet we don't see doctors getting lynched for performing appendectomies. This suggests to me that a large segment of the population is ignorant of basic biology. Perhaps that's why the same segment tends not to believe in evolution? Conventionally, the line has been drawn at the point where the fetus is able to survive independent of the mother. Perhaps a better place to draw it would be at the point at which the fetus attains consciousness. But it's not even clear whether this happens before or after birth. RodMcFeely's Hindu Cow argument is telling: what are the criteria that must be met to be considered a member of a society and entitled to its protections? I'd be interested to know whether there are any vegans who think waterboarding terrorists is acceptable. I also find it curious that the religiously-minded have no problem torturing the aforementioned terrorists and executing criminals, but scream bloody murder when an abortion is performed on a fetus that is unconscious, unable to function without its mother, and has less of a sense of individuality than your average cow. If we execute murderers, what do we do with fetuses that are killing their mothers?";3;0;3;yes

The answer is obvious but it doesn’t really add to the conversation. unless you’d like to explain it. No Unprotected sex due to a lack of education causes high teen pregnancy rates. Or overly religious (or conservative) parents who Don’t adequately prepare their children for it adds to it Example: Son, If you have sex before marriage your disowned and God will be angry. Boy later gets into a heated situation gives into his hormones and boom Early parenthood.. Could have been prevented if his parents were smart and said “we’d like you wait till marriage but if you do decide to do it wear a condom.” Making abortion Illegal is taking rights away from women, will cause there to be children brought up with inadequate care, and will create illegal abortions that are very unsafe and could cause the death of both the mother and unborn. Some kids now-a-days are abstinent even with that option. Educated ones who are not abstinent practice safe, sex (though there are some accseptions). Promoting Education and getting rid of some social stigmas is far better than forcing a young girl to become a parent before she is ready (emotionally and financially) and forcing the child to be brought up in less than desirable circumstances.

So I called you out when you associated pregnant teens to "stupid spoiled whores" It was a bad generalization and even if it was just an observation it was rude to say.

The child will also never experience pain, hate, loss, remorse, regret, it will never suffer. It will never be sad.

If scientists agreed with your view of their facts the same way you did, there would be a huge scientific outcry toward pro-life. Seems there's not. So, the questions then arise, if we agree to your view: 1) What to tell the 12 year old rape victim? 2) What to tell the incest victim? 3) What to tell the current 150,000 kids waiting for adoption now? 4) What do you tell the mother who's life could be saved if she has an abortion? 5) Who loves these unwanted children? There's going to be a lot. "According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there were 820,151 legal induced abortions in the US in 2005." Few and far between are the women who use abortion as a 'convenience'. It's often given as an argument, but I've found the people who I know who have been through it have been changed. They have never looked at it as 'just a thing' they did. So given the scenario of a world full of unwanted unloved children with bitter and possibly scarred for life mothers, or a safe and quick procedure to allow them to move past and get on with their lives, I choose to allow abortion.";3;0;3;Pro-Choice

The AMA did not just fight for criminalization, but also abortion under special circumstances, thus, giving the male physician total control over who may have abortions, forcing midwives out of business and establishing a medical patriarchy.

You are assuming two things: 1) All life on Earth was created, and 2) God exists. These are mere assertions without empirical basis. Let's assume God did create all life on Earth and ignore evolution for now. You also say this means only God "should" take life away. Well, God does. God is the ultimate abortionist. Miscarriages (or natural abortions) are far greater than intentional abortions. If we do not have the right, why should God? Since the baby is innocent, God is a jerk. More precisely, God is a murderer. Your "human centered" view leaves out the other life God "created." Let's look at biology. If you eat animals you are often eating something more advanced than a human fetus. You are then a worse murderer. Tell me how it's not all relative. "Well, animals no souls, we yes souls." We are animals! (We're all innocent as animals.) If God decided to miscarry my earlier form for no particular ascertainable reason, I would also not "be here." That (God abortion) was more likely than a people abortion. Why would I fear nonexistence? If I do not exist I can not fear. The number of people who could exist and do not is infinite. What about those not living right now or in the future? This is suspended potential existence, not different from you or I. You want me to think about my 1/infinity shot at existence.

Cases such as teen pregnancy and rape are good examples of why abortion should be allowed. Who wants to live with a child of a rapist or provide a child with hardship?

This cluster does not deserve the same rights as a person, especially seeing as there is a very real chance of miscarriage anyway.

Imagine a woman who is in med school, has sex, and gets pregnant despite taking every available precaution. What is she supposed to do? Quit school and work to save money to afford the baby? Get real. Abortions are performed all the time, and are incredibly safe. The rates of mothers that die due to complications either during pregnancy or during labour are much higher.

At the moment I'm drawn to both sides because a woman can have the baby and then give it up for adoption if she doesn't want a child or for any other reason.

Also, the law does not currently recognize a fetus as a legal person. 1. I am not aware of the statistics relating to health concerns and late-term abortions. Certain governments regulate late-term abortions, so I don't think that we should necessarily take up space arguing this right now. 2. This is true, there is no fail-safe birth control. 3. I see this as a reason that abortions should be legal, and more widely accepted. If abortions were more readily available, and therefore controlled, governments would be more able to regulate the procedure and ensure that the doctors performing the operation are competent. Illegal abortions would not stop people from seeking to abort. This would create a similar situation to that during prohibition. People who wanted alcohol, bought moonshine. This resulted in far greater poisonings than with regular alcohol. If doctors cannot perform abortions in regulated settings, people will seek back alley abortions from "doctors". 4. This argument is based on the assumption that the child will survive and also on the belief that life is in itself a positive. Philosophers are divided on the claim that "life itself" is an inherent 'good'. Also, I was not saying that these potential mothers are not competent, I was merely saying that perhaps their current circumstance prevented them from being proper parents (i.e. being 16, being in school, being too underemployed to provide for themselves and a child). This will not stop them from being excellent parents later in life. 5. I totally agree on this point. Also I think this is how schools that teach birth control methods currently do things (I was taught this way when I was in high school).";3;0;3;Yes
2;abortion;"All I am saying is that the mother constitutes a legal person (a fetus does not) and therefore her rights trump a potential child (I stress potential). No, if a woman gets pregnant despite all her efforts then she is extremely fertile. This has nothing to do with fate. Saying that the mother cannot abort the fetus because she is responsible for it is begging the question. I do not accept that the fetus has rights, therefore how does the mother owe it anything? If a woman suffers a traumatic rape, then she is not pouring her anger out on the fetus. Perhaps she is not at a stage in her life at which she wants a child. Or is capable of having one. What if the rape victim were 13? Should this 13 year old girl (yes, girl) be forced to become a mother when she is so young? If you were the child of such an attack, would you want to live your life knowing that your mother always associated you with the event? What if you were the victim, and what if you always associated the child with the attack? How is that fair to the child? No, it is not the child's fault. But you know what? It's not the mother's fault either. Why should she have to suffer, and possibly ruin her entire life because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time? "A mistake will never be corrected by doing another mistake": also begging the question. I do not accept your premise, so why would I accept an identical conclusion? A fetus is not recognized as a person, therefore abortion is not murder. A zygote has more in common with an amoeba than it does a human being.";3;0;3;Yes
2;abortion;"The mother is in charge of her own body. If she wants an abortion, she is entitled to it. It is impossible to know what goes through any mind but your own. Perhaps bearing an unwanted child (or one forced upon you) is too much to bear. Pregnancy is accompanied by incredible emotional, and physical stress and pain. It is unfair to ask anyone who does not want to go through this (especially rape victims) to do so.";3;0;3;Yes
4045;abortion;"I think abortion should be legal because some women use abortion as birth control. If you are going to have sex, proper protection is not 100% effective. It isn't fair for a life to be burdened because someone wanted to have fun, but pregnancy occurred despite proper protections.";3;0;3;Yes
4045;abortion;"The question is more about what life is and what it is not than responsibility and maturity (though we both certainly are proponents of contraception). It's also about women's rights and not relegating them to second class status in the home. Society doesn't recognize this work as part of social production, so women do it for free and often have the double burden of also having to work for a wage outside of the home. I'd read or reread pgandal's Feb. 23 and 24 excellent points on life v. potential life. How would you rebut that?";3;0;3;Yes
4901;abortion;"2 reasons: - Let all babies be wanted babies. Knowing that you were unwanted but the parent was prohibited from getting an abortion can be pretty emotionally devastating to some. - Anyone who doesn't want their baby so much as to have them terminated would not be a good parent. If they could care less about their child, the kid will grow up uncared for and possibly even abused, malnourished, or neglected. Here's my solution: once you find out you're pregnant (unintentionally), immediately look for an adopter, and if that fails, get an abortion.";3;0;3;"It's right"
4907;abortion;"It is a woman's prerogative. Carrying a fetus to term, giving birth, and ensuring proper care and education of another human being is an enormous responsibility. The energy that it requires is solely responsible for the social division of the sexes, and the burden it puts on women causes them to become second-class citizens in many cultures and throughout much of human history. Becoming pregnant too young drastically reduces the opportunities for women and makes them dependent on individuals (usually husbands) who can share the burden. It has been said that with great power comes great responsibility. I would like to propose the converse – with great responsibility come the right to the corresponding power. If women are naturally put in the position of responsibility for the lives they bring into the world, due to being solely burdened with the pregnancy, then they should also be entitled to the right to decide when and if they will do so. From this perspective, the mother’s inherent responsibility overrides the prospective child’s right to life until responsibility for the child's bodily existence can at least be shared or passed onto another willing individual. If this is not the case, then the mother’s life becomes captive to the State that would protect the prospective child’s life at the expense of the woman’s rights. It has been said that women already have the right to decide when they get pregnant by controlling when they have sex. However, while sex is the only way to get pregnant, that is not the only reason to have sex. Sex is also important for forging satisfying romantic relationships, which have their own intrinsic value for increasing happiness and life fulfillment aside from reproduction. So requiring women who do not currently want to have children to forgo sex all together to prevent accidental pregnancy requires them to deprive themselves of an important tool for creating and sustaining meaningful relationships, and creates unfair pressure for them to let go of other ambitions because they have to be ready for the possibility of parenthood. This is ironic given that building truly lasting and stable relationships that can best support a child often takes practice with several different partners over a course of years. This is not to say that happy marriages never emerge among first loves, just that it is rare and most people need space to learn and practice. In today’s society, both women and men need the freedom to be able to have serious, romantic sexual relationships long before they are prepared to have children. Part of this is because bringing up modern members of society requires much more investment in education and training before becoming self-sufficient and productive adults that no longer depend on their parents. People want to give their children the biggest advantage that they can, and for many that involves being educated well into adulthood and waiting until “the nest” is as well supplied and stable as possible – these days that often is not achieved until almost 15 years after puberty. It is not reasonable to expect adults to remain abstinent for that long, or for accidents not to happen. I am not saying that all women should get abortions for every unexpected pregnancy and should never sacrifice other goals for the unexpected accidental person found inside her. But it should be the woman's decision whether she is ready and in a position to make the sacrifice to responsibly carry a baby to term, or if the burden would be too great on her, her family, her partner, and on her current or future children. This can and should depend on her personal values and beliefs in addition to her situation, and some women should never get an abortion if it is something that they cannot live with. This creates room to celebrate the sacrifice a woman makes of her body and life when she does decide to give birth from an unexpected pregnancy, because it was indeed a beautiful *choice*. And if she does not, then that is her right and privilege as a woman. It is not a choice that any except a few depraved individuals would ever take lightly.";3;0;3;"It's right"
4911;abortion;"All right: While a fetus may be just a bunch of cells that feels nothing until birth or an actual being who feels everything, who are we to judge what other people do? Why do WE need to choose what is right for people? I understand religious morals, however, haven't we already defecated on and gone against numerous religious morals already for it to not matter anymore? FIRSTLY, people at least 95% of the time fail to take into account the number of women that DO want the child they are supposed to be having, but do not have the finances to care for it. While she may love her child to absolute death, how would it be fair for that child to have to live off of hand-me-downs from distant cousins and two dollar shirts that are too small or large from the Salvation Army? What if the child has no meals except for lunch on weekdays at school(due to that free/reduced lunch agreement some schools have)? Now, pretending that this is all an actual scenario, this child will not be able to focus in school and will probably work for the duration of his/her life. For that child's ENTIRE life, he/she will think, "Was I the reason we had to live in a tiny apartment and live off of welfare?"All of this said, please explain to me how it is okay for a child to have nothing to wear or eat and have a terribly guilty conscience over something that isn't his/her fault as long as we aren't getting rid of lives. Secondly, we tackle the situation of the stereotypical woman who "doesn't care about her child and just wants it sucked out ASAP." Yes, birth control could have been used (even though it DOES fail). Yes, it was irresponsible. The best rebuttal to this is "Shoulda, woulda, coulda." What's done is done, a woman is now pregnant. Now what do we do, shun her from society and disallow her from legally having her child aborted? First of all, illegal abortions would increase at a substantially accelerated rate which would be unsafe to both the child AND the woman, however, staying more focused on the main point, if we deem it as wrong, what will she do? Scenario A: Give it up for adoption Scenario B: Do something drastic(as earlier mentioned) Scenario A: Children in adoption centers is a horrible thing to think about. While you MAY think that it's a beautiful sunshine-y rainbow unicorn glitterfest, it's actually one of the farthest things from that. Adopting children at adoption agencies is like, as sad as it is to say, ALMOST identical to adopting a puppy from a pet store, cutest and youngest ones are gone first. Basically what I'm saying is that if this kid is not the cutest thing in the world or young or doesn't have some kind of super talent, his/her chances of adoption are significantly low. Then this poor kid has to spend his/her entire childhood in a foster home, bouncing from home to home. That is not a fair situation for the child, and there is absolutely no strong oppositional point that I have ever seen to this. Now, what if the mother has a steady relationship with her partner, but is supposed to have a child with mental, physical, and/or genetic issues? Is this mother supposed to suck it up and give birth to it anyway, because it'd inhumane to not do so? Absolutely not. Unaware if you know this, but not all families have millions of dollars they can spend, paying to help correct these issues will essentially suck these families' savings dry, and that's if they have any money to BEGIN with. Some may say that it's cold-hearted to "get rid" of a child just because something will be "wrong" with him/her, but if a child has to suffer and then die not long after his/her entrance to this world, why should that mother give birth to him/her? There will be so much more pain for that child to have to be constantly sick (for years possibly) until finally dying and not knowing what it's like to be really happy and carefree than for a mother to just terminate her pregnancy early to save him/her from that illness. In conclusion, we have no right to judge it as wrong.";3;0;3;"It's right"

Secondly abortion as a murder of unborn children. When does ''life'' begin ? Some people say that it's begin since the embryo starts to move in womb .It is an innoticible border, when fetus became a person, who is protected by law and has equal right for life. Abortion is a action that prove women's rights and freedom, they can do whatecer they want with their own bodies but not other person's body.

4277;abortion;""Once concieved, abortion is technically murdering the baby. It may not be out of the womb, but it is still living and breathing." This statement makes three assumptions: 1. An unborn child is still a baby. This is simply not true. Biologically speaking, there is a vast difference between a fetus and a baby, the most obvious one being a physical separation from its mother. Even aside from that, there's an even greater difference between an egg that has been fertilized and a baby, which you apparently still consider a baby since you refer to the point of conception. My point is that there is simply too great a biological difference to claim that a baby and a fetus or anything that comes before one are equivalent. 2. Aborting the unborn child is murder. This assumes that the unborn child can be classified as a living organism. Given its biological attachment to the mother and its lack of physical development, it could be argued that it is not truly a living organism until it becomes separate from its mother. To be perfectly honest, there isn't a universally accepted definition of what it means to be alive or not, especially when dealing with biological organisms. However, even if you refuse to accept the idea I proposed as true and instead propose your own argument, you must understand that your ideals cannot necessarily be applied to others without solid evidence. Without an objective argument to be made, your ideas can only be applied to yourself, leaving others to make their own decisions on the matter. "Those who say pregnant women should have the choice dont make sense to me. In that sense, what if the affirmative's parents believed that? Then they would not even exist." Your point being? This does not in any way detract from the proposed argument. All it does is put the proponents of the argument in a position where they would be less likely to support the rights they are arguing for. That does not necessarily mean the rights they are arguing for are wrong, all it means is that the proponents could possibly be hypocrites.";3;0;3;Yay
5045;abortion;"If a women is raped, she deserves the right to get an abortion. Plus, how would it feel if she did not get it and the child had to live its life knowing it was not meant to be born?

If the mother learns from a doctor that the baby will be born stillborn or will have a low likelihood of surviving long or will have severe/incurable/etc. health issues, she deserves the right to make that choice. If you are poor, it is no excuse, adoption is the answer. It all depends on the situation. You CANNOT lump every abortion together.

1445;abortion;"They have cutoff dates for abortions, correct me if i am wrong, in around the sixth moth period. I am neither pro life or pro choice but i have some arguments that are valid. You say that a baby is a baby at conception? I have heard so many people say that, only to find out they use the morning after pill. Is the fetus only alive after the 6 days it takes for a test to come up positive? the morning after pill is like having chance for an abortion every time you take it. everyone who has had to take it has probably had a few abortions themselves. People who are pro choice often say that the mothers are miseducated, but the doctors explain exactly what is going to happen to every single pregnant woman who walks in. they know what they are doing, and have made their own decision. I agree that the father has equal right to decide, but what if one wants an abortion and the other doesn't? What then?

Wouldn't it be better to stop it from entering the world? It is only when the parents are financially well, emotionally and psychologically prepared that it must be gone forward with.

4277;abortion;"1). I am afraid you are very much mistaken: a toddler is not classified as a man due to the age and physiological differences, while both can be males, the words 'toddler' and 'man' are mutually exclusive in regards to the literal meaning of each. And when I referred to a fetus relying on its mother, I was referring to the fact that were it to be separated from its mother while still in the fetal state, it would likely not survive due to it not being developed enough to exist as a separate living organism. I agree that both a baby and a fetus are dependent on a parental figure, however, the reasons for this dependence are very different. A good way of understanding the difference I am speaking of is this: if a mother were to die, her baby would not immediately begin to die along with her, where as a fetus would due to the mother and the fetus being physically linked. I apologize if I had not made that clear, and I can go into greater detail if you feel I am still being vague. 2). First, I never referred to the fetus as "a flea that sucks off a dog's blood to survive", and I would very much like it if you did not misrepresent my argument. Second, I said quite clearly that there is no universal definition of 'living', I was playing the devil's advocate and proposing a definition that opposed your own, and then pointing out how some people accept that definition, and that there is nothing objective that makes your definition better than theirs due to a lack of a universally accepted specific definition of what is a living organism. Once again, I apologize if I hadn't made this clear. Third, I have to once again point out that you are equating two very different kinds of dependencies: a grown man needs things like food and water to survive, but will not immediately begin to expire if they weren't exposed to these things 24/7, a fetus will immediately begin to expire if it were to be unexposed to its mother, or if its mother were to die (this is assuming that we are still discussing a fetus that is a significant amount of time away from birth, the closer you get to birth, the greater number of differences between the odds of any two fetuses surviving). I am concerned that you may have misunderstood much of my previous argument considering the responses you gave. If I have not been clear on anything, please inform me and I will do my best to clarify any vague comments made on my part.";3;0;3;Yay
5046;abortion;"First off, please fix your grammar. Your point is very hard to read. I'm actually not sure if you're trolling or not. I'm hoping you are just trolling. If you're not then, yeah, the doctors tell them that abortion is the best option because it's true. A fifteen year old cannot raise a child, easy as that. Yeah, there are some cases where it works out. But most of the time it doesn't and the child is not raised properly. Women will always get abortions, that will never change. Women will go to sketchy back-alleys for abortions if that's what it takes. Back when abortion was illegal, that's what women did. Do you know how many women died? To this day 70,000 women die a year because of illegal abortions. A fetus is unable to have any type of thinking until around 8 months in utero. Even then, it's very low-level thinking. Some women will regret having an abortion, but it's still their choice. It's better to have an abortion then to raise a child in Hell for 18 years. Adoption these days are hardly an option, foster homes are full to the brim with unwanted kids. Adoption isn't like Juno. Abortion is the most sensible options for any unwanted pregnancy.";3;0;3;Yay

If it's safe to make an abortion, the choice should be there. There are plenty of unwanted babies there looking for home, the life is hard enough already without introducing unwanted babies. Therefore abortion, like adoption should remain a choice. Killing a baby is legally, and ethically wrong. Aborting a fetus (within the legal framework) is legal. As far as ethics go, the mother and the family make that decision. There is nothing wrong with abortions. Most abortion are spontaneous, done naturally by the body for various reasons.";3;1;3;Yes

But going back to the fact that there could be diseases that are transmitted from the the mother to the baby, does this mean that, knowing that for example, we would bring out a baby who will be sick? I really don't see how, in that situation, abortion is bad. Other case, if the mother doesn't want the child, do you think she'll happily raise the baby? If the baby comes out and isn't love... is that better than abortion? It can be seen in different ways, but I really don't think that abortion is a bad thing.";3;1;3;Yes

I don't try to make you wear a sandwich board saying, "Kick me in the face." If I don't try to influence you, why should you try to influence me? Now, what if you were in a room with a woman who decided to abort? A normal, good woman, who decided she can't have the kid? Are you going to try to influence that woman? I'll leave the question rhetorical. Once again, it's their decision. Their body. Their rules. Not yours. Deal with it.";3;1;3;Yes
5147;abortion;"Let me begin by saying that I believe that both sides of this argument have perfectly valid arguments. I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to this. In fact, there isn't any sort of inherent moral nature with regard to the topic, but rather a personal view of the issue which we see through our own moral lens. Personally, I am pro-choice. And I decided this because I asked myself the same question that both sides of the argument have asked themselves: what rights are to be owed to this fetus? And, more importantly, why? I believe the fetus, by virtue of its existence, represents potential and it has the right to be regarded as such. It represents the potential to be a human being, to have a place in this society, and to be a contributing element of society. As far as why, I don't think any elaboration is necessary to answer that question: we all start out as potential. What might justify an abortion is a consideration of the infants potential with regard to the circumstances that surround the woman who is giving birth to the infant. Can the woman support the infant? Will the infant have a nurturing environment to grow in? From a demographical standpoint, the woman might want to consider the population density of where she lives, and how bringing in another life to that population might affect the overall population. I do not believe in arbitrarily aborting a child. But if, after having considered some of the things I've mentioned, the mother decides that it is best not to have the child, if only to, for example, prevent the child from going through a childhood that would be hardly conducive to a meaningful life and perhaps more so towards a miserable one, then that really is her choice. It is the responsibility of the parent figure to decide what is best for his or her child. One may argue that by choosing to abort, the parent is depriving the child of even having a chance to thrive in the world. But a just-as-valid counterargument might be posed suggesting that the such has been considered and the means to encourage and nurture that kind of life are ultimately lacking or entirely unavailable. The issue of abortion is neither definitively a good thing or a bad thing. While from a moral standpoint, some may not believe it to be the rightful choice of the mothers, it is inevitable that it will still be the mothers (or most likely, rather) who make the decision. So if we truly believe in either pro-choice or pro-life, it is decidedly up to our own volition to promote our respective views so that those making the decisions may potentially be enlightened with our own views.";3;1;3;Yes

If you consider all of those senses, people who have disabilities wouldn't be considered human. But feeling is a must. Don't we always say that people who are cold and have no feeling are not humans? Well here's the same thing. The fetus isn't a human yet. Besides, according to Stats Canada, most cases of abortions are done before the first 12 weeks. You say that if the unborn baby had a voice it wouldn't want to be killed. True. I agree with that, but here's the thing it doesn't. It doesn't know what death is. They don't know what sufferance is! I repeat, it is not a human yet! To your argument that says that you were nothing in the womb and were only something once outside, do you remember what it was like in there? Did you have any memories whatsoever that confirms that you were living before those 12 months and that you felt something? You do understand that if the fetus is removed, it doesn't even realise it, right? To your other argument concerning their guilt, it was decision. They decided that they couldn't handle the baby. I'm gonna ask one honest question, would you rather see a woman feel guilty and depress for a long or short while or see both the child and the mother suffering because of diverse reasons? As for the doctor situation, as you said it, they never wanted to cause any harm. We are humans, we make mistake too. People sue them. If they were to win in court wouldn't the money come back to the patient? But here's the thing : operations have risks, you accepted them. Don't go blaming the doctor who is, hopefully, trying his best to make a good operation. And I'm gonna apologize beforehand. I never said anything about prematured babies. I'm talking about a fetus that might have, oh I don't know, HIV? handicaps? Will they have a healthy life? I doubt it. A normal, could be. But healthy, I wouldn't bet on that. Just for an exemple, per 10000 cases of HIV, 2500 of those cases are caused by childbirth. Meaning the child gets the virus from the mother. Which is the second main cause of the transmission of the virus.";3;1;3;Yes
912;abortion;"There are two types of abortions Legal and Illegal. In places where abortions are not legal, illegal ones happen. Illegal ones often result in terrible side effects and many times death. Might I ask if you could define your side a little better. If you claim your pro life in light of this tidbit I will laugh at the hypocrisy. heres a though. Abortions happen. The best way to deal with it... well its not to go around telling young girls that they are sluts as well as murderers but rather to increase education. Push for a better sex ed program that teaches about the risks of pregnancy, the responsibilities of parenthood, the options of contraceptives and why they are more favourable than abortion (without getting into the name calling)";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"Exactly. You have done nothing to ruin my point. People, sadly, may I add, have the ability to throw away their life to drugs, illegal activities, sex, and alcohol. But it's their body. They can decide what to do with it, good or bad. Now, we can try to influence them to get away from those vices, but we can't decide for them. It's their decision, not yours. By the way, I don't believe in legalizing heroin or PCP. The fact that you're saying without even knowing me whatsoever is extremely offensive. I'm sure most of the other people on this site wouldn't do something like that.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"I have said this before and I'll say this again. We can try to influence a woman's decision, to abort or not. A father has the right to INFLUENCE not DECIDE as you and I have the right to influence. He can tell the mother, "Honey, let's keep the kid," but the woman can still decide no and vice versa. In the end, it is solely the woman's choice, as it is her body. On the comment of the baby, the baby (in my opinion) is not alive yet, therefore the woman can decide, with the same decision for her as giving blood away. Let's ignore abortion for the moment. Let's say the two of us are kids on a playground. You have a toy that I want. I ask you if you could share it with me. That's me trying to influence you. Now, do you have to follow influence? No. You can decide to keep the toy, or give it. That's your decision. This is how the decision making for abortion works. The father can influence, but he can't decide. It's up to the woman. It's her body and she decides. Not her spouse. Not her father. Not her neighbor. And definitely not some random stranger. We can try to influence, but that's it. It's down to the mother.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"Well, it's the mother's baby, therefore it's her decision. She can decide what she wants to do with the baby. Whatever is in her body counts as her body. Her body, her choice. Her baby, her choice. As for the "When does life begin?" that is a whole another debate. Since we have different definitions, we're not on equal ground. I say life begins when the baby leaves the womb.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"That person should be charged with one murder in my mind, but that question is irrelevant. The father has a right with the mother: he has the right to influence her decision. What he doesn't have is the right to decide. He can say, "I think..." or "I would like..." but he can't say, "My decision is...". It's not his body. Yes he might have helped create the baby, yes he might have bought all the baby supplies, yes he might have even bought a house for the family, but no matter what effort he put in, he still can't decide. It's her body, and her body alone. Not his.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"The difference between a baby two days from birth and a baby that is just born is that the baby two days from birth is not making independent decisions: the mother is. Therefore the mother can make the decision whether or not to abort, at any point of its nine months in the woman. This is just a matter of a mother's rights, it's her body, and the baby is inside her body. The baby cannot decide for itself, and the mother does. So therefore, she does, and only she, has the the right to abort.";3;1;3;Yes

I'm definitely going to do that. I came here wanting to debate, but it's clear that neither of us want to change our minds. All in all, I'm done with this right now. That's the bottom line.";3;1;3;Yes
2812;abortion;"Well i kinda missed the heat of the argument sadly... but here's what i think. Many people argue pro-life based on a babies potential for life (including people in this debate). This is clearly a flawed argument however. so called "potential for life" can be traced back to long before a babies conception, it could be argued that its "potential for life" is when a husband and wife meet for the first time. By this argument, birth control pills should be prohibited because we are essentially "killing unborn babies" and even more extreme: kids should be encouraged to have sex because any child who does not when they are older is "killing" all of those babies she had the potential of making. The potential for life should not be considered in abortion decisions, only ACTUAL life should be considered. In this debate, is see pro-lifers are arguing that babies are "alive" and "can feel pain." Yet strangely enough the vast majority of pro-life people are NOT vegetarians and are willingly inflicting pain upon hundreds if not thousands of animals throughout the course of their lifetime! The ability of something to feel pain also does not give it basic human rights at all. In fact, many would argue that although unborn babies can technically feel pain, their brains are not yet developed enough to "understand" that this pain is... well... painful! they just feel another sensation. Also, as we all know, babies do not have a developed memory. This means that although they may feel pain at one moment, the next they have forgotten about the pain and essentially it is as though the pain never even happened! Killing (as you call it) an unborn baby is in fact much BETTER than killing an animal because the animals have fully developed memory and fully developed senses, and they will realize what is happening to them. All in all, neither an argument based on potential for life nor one based on unborn babies ACTUAL life stands up to YOUR own actions. You betray your beliefs every day, and consider what you are doing perfectly fine(because it it perfectly fine). it would be absurd to force people to constantly make babies or to be vegetarians, and for us to live our lives, others must make sacrifices.";3;1;3;Yes

Also, what of the abortions of fetuses with anencephaly? After reading some of your previous posts in this topic I see one line of reasoning you use quite a bit to justify your stance is "the pain inflicted upon the unborn child", This would seem plausible after the first 4-to-5 weeks after conception once the cerebral cortex has begun to develop but before that stage this argument would seem to have little merit.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"1.) Throughout history, people have used four words to make a point. MLK said, "I have a dream." John Lennon said, "Give peace a chance." They didn't need to explain their four words, and so do I. Personally, I am a low man. I am a simple guy, drifting through life, like we all are. Therefore, I just make simple points, and stick with them. This is my simple point: it's the woman's choice. Not yours. Do I need to explain that more? 2.) Honestly, about the credibility thing, I'll ask you this: so what? I'm not worrying about my credibility as much as I'm not worrying about what I'm eating for dinner next week. I said we should take a break, simply that. I came back to debate more. Is that wrong? On the contrast, you came back to the debate, unabated by anyone. You listened to my advice as much as I did.

The question, "Are you glad your mother didn't choose abortion?" is irrelevant. It's like asking, "Are you glad you woke up this morning?" Or, "Are you glad you live in a house?" It's irrelevant, because we know what the answer is going to be, and really it doesn't matter. 3.) No one has touched the matter of partial birth abortions because no one has mentioned it up to this point, no more, no less. 4.) You keep attacking my number one defensive quote, "It's the woman's choice." You say, I should move on, pick another quote, explain myself. Why? You've listed no reasons. Why? I think I know, you're angry. You're upset that my simple, four word argument is trumping your long one. Therefore you try to insult me, and berate me to give up. You're not phasing me, as much as I am not clearly phasing you. This is why I stopped last time. This has gone from a debate to a shouting match. Let's actually debate the topic. Please.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"1.) I think you have a misunderstanding of the laws. Kevorkian got in trouble because he ASSISTED people in killing themselves. The people who killed themselves didn't get in trouble, it was Kevorkian. Kevorkian provided the equipment, told the people what to do, and followed through with it. In theory, Kevorkian killed them, with the person's permission. 2.) About your analogy with the woman: she's not in trouble with the law because of her attempt. She's not taken into jail in a police car, given a trial and having one strike on her record. Yes, she taken to a mental facility, and yes, she gets questioned, but that's to assure that she doesn't try to kill herself again. Assurance, yes, arrest, no. And there is no "mandatory trip to the nuthouse". If you tried to kill yourself, I'm sure you would feel better once you've gotten some help. 3.) Thank you for not going ballistic from my last argument. I think I got a little too high and mighty on that one. Looking back, I'm not sure what I was thinking. Thanks for not getting angry. I apologize if I offended you in any way. 4.) To be completely honest, I don't see a case where, "It's the woman's choice, not yours," is a false phrase. In abortion, it's completely true. A pregnant woman doesn't stand over your shoulder and tell you what to do. As I've said before, you have the right to influence, but not decide. Why should you decide for a pregnant woman? You have no right to, no obligation to. It's her body. Not yours. It's that simple.";3;1;3;Yes
4763;abortion;"The thing here is that the second person in question- the baby- is inside the body of the woman. The woman is deciding everything for the baby. The baby is in her- still her body. If it's in her body, it's her body. She can decide what to do with her body, as she can decide if she wants to give blood or organs after she dies. If she makes decisions for the baby, then she can decide what to do with it. If she wants to keep it, let her. But she wants to abort it, let her. It's her choice. The baby is an extension of her. Her body, her rules. She can do what she wants. If she makes the decisions for the baby, then she can decide what to do with it. Simple as that.";3;1;3;Yes

5152;abortion;"It is ok to kill a baby when it isn't a baby. That was pretty easy. But I'm going to further this argument so I can make it clear why my contention should stand. To determine when a life has actually started, and when destroying that life would actually constitute legal murder, I think we have to establish when that life falls under certain principles. So what constitutes a human life? I'm going to have to say anything past the level of fetus, so roughly 5-6 months after conception. Anything before that, it is simply not a human life. It does not have human attributes, it merely has "potential" for human life. Yet destroying potential is not the same as actually destroying life. If this were so, then masturbation would be considered murder, and so would the use of contraception. I could argue this the other way however, and say that abortion has some valuable merit on its own, being that our population is rising to quickly, we're running out of resources, and teen pregnancy is deplorably high.

Because they aren't highly intelligent beings walking around, talking and living their life out. In the end, a human is not a "Human" until they have a brain and are using it to learn about and engage the world. Do you consider an individual sperm to be a human? What about a solitary ovum? Of course not. Each is a single cell. Each is half of the final product: A solitary, fertilized egg. A lone cell, or two separate cells used to make it, are not in and of themselves a human. A cancerous growth, inside a human, is not itself human. It's just a small group of cells from that person. You have no problem killing the cancerous cells because even though they are technically part of that human, they are individual cells, and those individual cells are causing an issue for a much larger group of cells: "the human". I just can't see a group of cells as being a child until the group of cells includes a brain. The brain being the focal point of our uniqueness, I'd say that's a fair way to look at it.";3;1;3;Disagree

Keep in mind, some girls can become pregnant as early as 8 years old. Pregnant women need to buy maternity clothes, probably more food, and all the things for the nursery. I can safely assume that there ARE people that can't afford that. Perhaps they are still in school, they can't work all the time to get income, some of the time, I can see it. If they can't pay for the expenses, how would you afford the child when it's born? 'You could put the child up for adoption.' What if there is something that could possibly harm you while giving birth? What if a C-section is out of the question? What if it is a known fact the child won't survive its infant stage? What if you had a medical problem that could cause childbirth to be fatal? Now think, what if it was you? What if you were a 12-year-old girl who was raped and is now pregnant?

In my case, I believe life begins at conception and I would find abortion morally wrong, because I see conception as the beginning of life and to me, terminating a baby would feel like murdering a visible person, but different in some ways such as if I were a woman that it would kill part of you along with it, the fact that you could have loved this baby if it was born. I would never hold a situation as an excuse to have an abortion (e.g. Rape, unwanted, booze whatever).

2815;abortion;"The choice to abort or not should be legal, because women should have this right to determine what happens to their bodies. The ethical and moral choice is also theirs to make. Others should not be allowed to force choices based on their opinion or belief. There are other viable choices that one can choose to abortion. One can carry the child to term, and adopt the baby out. The Birth Mother is given the opportunity to choose "forever families" for the baby. The government does not pay any portion regarding this baby's birth. All finances for Birth Mother,(care, prenatal care, birthing, hospital etc) are paid for by the adopting family. AGAIN, Legality of abortion is an ethical and moral choice that belongs ONLY to the Birth Mother. What YOU choose to believe regarding abortion is directly proportionate to YOUR opinion both ethically and morally, and should not have any bearing on the ethical or moral choice of the Birth Mother. A baby is not the problem, even if Rape is at fault. The consequence of Rape can be pregnancy and is definitely a crisis situation for the Birth Mother. However, the mind is a strange thing. One cannot understand, how one of the consequences of rape, could be carried for nine months without hatred or prejudice, BUT I can promise you, (having worked with Crisis Pregnancies up close and personal for over twenty years,) Birth Moms are amazing, and with the right environment and care, babies under these circumstances are born daily, and Mom goes through the process the same way every woman goes through it. Mom comes out on the other side of the nine months probably in better psychological health than you are right now. The key with crisis pregnancies is they must be handled with proper residential, physical, mental, emotional, educational care. I personally do not believe in abortion, but the legality of the question is that abortion is not my choice. The choice is Birth Mom's, should remain a legal choice, and Mom MUST NOT be placed in stressful situations just to appease someone else's beliefs or choices. Again not MY choice or belief, but I will defend her choice to decide. For those who do not know me, I have helped teen girls and fellows making this choice for a long time. My agency has over forty eight babies adopted into "forever families," and I have also worked with Baby Moms and Dads that have chosen to keep their babies and are now parenting them. We also have successful single parenting cases, that are working just fine. None of these families are on government assistance, and all are now responsible members of their communities. These results are because they were given second chances to learn, train, and meet their new goals. Our adopted babies are all healthy and living in their "forever families", without incident.";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"
2815;abortion;"Thank you for your reply. If there are interested parties, other than the Mother, a petition to the court can resolve the problem. The court appoints a Guardian ad litem on behalf of the unborn child (fetus) and the interested parties. They look at all of the circumstances and then report to the court their findings and the defense on the child's welfare. Usually we are talking about unwed Moms and the prospective Dad is not in the picture or for that matter, can not be found. In those cases the court and in fact the law allows the Mom the right to make the choice whether to carry or abort the child (fetus). As i previously stated, I do not believe or condone abortion, however, because legality of abortion has been decided, I must abide by the "law of the land." Until it is presented on a ballot to be abolished, or the court rules on the issue, what I believe is just an opinion.";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"

2815;abortion;"Elliot: As a matter of fact, I own a teen maternity home. Also in my State, I serve in my community as a Guardian ad litem. For the most part I speak on behalf of those that cannot speak for themselves. This includes any child under the age of majority, and in some instances on behalf of the welfare of the unborn. This happens when someone petitions the court because an under age Mom is electing to abort her unborn child. This is usually either the underage Dad or the Grandparents that do not agree with the decision and they are trying to get the judge and the court to rule in their favor. So at least in my State, I would not agree that the court would not appoint someone to act on their behalf. I believe every State has this type service, but cannot say this is so. If your State does not have this service, perhaps you can be the voice that introduces it. After talking to a lot of people, and doing much research,(called "due diligence") the Guardian presents finding to the court so that a judgment regarding welfare can be made. There are many factors involved and the court does not rule on whether a child will live or die. The decision is based on the mental status, knowledge, and understanding of the person seeking to abort. Questions like who will care for, be responsible, and what the circumstances are for seeking the procedure. Right now it costs about $20,000. 00 (rounded up) a year to raise a child. Then there is the amount to care for the Mom to be able to sustain both herself and a child. This is only one area that the court looks at. They also take mental capability, and at any medical aspects that uphold the abortion. They also take the Dad, or Grandparents, or whomever is petitioning the court into consideration. What the motivation for the petition, plus so much more. The underlying reasoning is why someone is taking away a Mother's right for her body is also looked at. A petition is not treated lightly, and consideration for the unborn child is also a factor. So, abortion is not a cut and dried decision. When someone petitions a court, it is handled with care and family court uses the Department of Children and Families for their input as well. The problem arises because not many people petition the court, but rather try to handle it themselves. Then you have families fighting, frustrated Dads because no one wants to listen to him, and then of course the Mom who is trying to make the best decision for herself, (not always the right one,) but instead is stressed to the max by everyone trying to persuade her with their input. Outside entities resort to assigning guilt for her decisions, or making her life miserable because Mom tries to shut down and shut out those folks that know exactly what she should do or how she should feel. As I have said before, and will continue to say, There are many alternatives to abortion." If a Mom facing life or abortion makes a decision that does not agree with your opinion, instead of condemnation, try looking at her reasoning. Is abortion right or wrong? Each person must decide for themselves. Personally for me, I do not agree with abortion but I do believe in the right of choice. I did not always think this way, and it took me many years to get to the place where I am now. The reason I now believe in a maternity home atmosphere is to allow a place where stress is minimal, and allows people a safe place to learn about alternative choices. We offer other things necessary to successful independent living, and for those that decide to keep their child, education, on the job training and assistance from a living support coach to help with other factors that are some of the underlying reason's for a Mom's choice.";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"
1023;abortion;"Another question I have, I once dated a girl who had a medical condition and the doctor told her that childbirth could very well cause her death, If she were to get pregnent, should she have to sacrifice herself for the child? If a woman wants to keep a child, go through a pregnancy, then NO ONE should forcer her to have an abortion. At the same time, if a woman does not want to go through a pregnency, and they dont want to do an adoption or other posibilities, then NO ONE should force her to carry out a pregnency. Of corse there is a limit, I dont think its ok to have an abortion a few weeks before someone is due. but its hard to pinpoint where to draw the line.";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"
1023;abortion;"I agree that this is one of the trickier debates, but I believe that forcing a woman to carry out a pregnancy that she never wanted is wrong. I do not believe life begins at conception, and not every culture does either. One question that I have for the Pro-Life subscribers is that if you believe that life begins at conception, and anything done to harm the fetus after that very moment is an act of murder, (including birth control, morning after pill, plan B, and ofcorse abortion) then what about women who have miscarages? People go to jail for neglabal homicide, its not murder because it was not with malitious intent, it was an accident. Mothers and fathers go to jail for not feeding their children enough, or not protecting them as much as they should have. So should a woman who wasnt getting enough bed rest, or was extremly stressed and as a result losses the child go to jail? or atleast be investigated? go to court? Anyone who believes that life truly begins at conception and abortion doctors are commiting murder, and people who have abortions are paying somone to murder their child cannot escape the question of what to do with a miscarage";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"
5705;abortion;"Okay. Just going to add a point here by saying that... well, do you really think making it illegal is going to SOLVE anything, for one? Think about it. Rape is illegal. It still happens. Murder, also illegal. Still happens, Drugs. Illegal. Happens. Why do you think abortion will be any different? I'm bringing this up because if abortion is made illegal, many women are going to want, maybe even NEED back-alley abortions. They are going to get them, and I shouldn't have to say this but just in case you aren't aware, back-alley abortions are EXTREMELY dangerous and risky. Would you rather the procedure be done legally, safely, hygienically, and painlessly as possible, OR, would you rather have it done illegally, dangerously, filthily, and probably very painfully?? Think about it. Of course, this isn't my only point, as there are QUITE many, but it's one that I don't see here, at least not yet( I haven't read to the bottom), and I thought it should be here.";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"
2815;abortion;"Read up on Guardian ad Litem. This service might not be available in all states, but it should be. This service trains people to speak in the courts on behalf of those that cannot speak for themselves, (sick, aged, the young, the unborn are some examples.) Many parents, grand Parents, and proposed Dads, use this service to speak regarding their position, the plight of the newborn to be, and the situation at hand. I believe if you do this research, many of your questions will be answered.";3;0;3;"Abortion should be legal"
