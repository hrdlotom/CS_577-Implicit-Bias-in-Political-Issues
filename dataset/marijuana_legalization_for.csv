21;"marijuana legalization";"Cigarettes have caused the death of millions, through lung cancer. Cigarettes also kill brain cells. Heck, holding your breath makes you lose brain cells. Marijuanna is a hell of a lot healthier than cigarettes and I think it should be legalized rather than cigs.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

1323;"marijuana legalization";"I disagree with King. It's pertinent to the discussion to address cigarettes and alcohol. If we've criminalized marijuana because of its danger, we should see if other things are more dangerous that are legal. If they are, then that is evidence that it's okay to legalize marijuana. I'm nearly a straight arrow. I've never smoked anything, and I drink once every few years, but I think marijuana should be legal. By legalizing it, the black market that involves it will disappear and so will the crime and gangs that go along with those black markets. (I understand that this isn't a cure for drug-related crime, but it will alleviate it). Furthermore, I have a natural desire to prevent government from treating us like we're too irresponsible to live our own lives. As long as what we do does not adversely affect others, I think it should be legal. More illicit drugs I'm not sure about because one mistake can lead to a physical inability to discontinue use.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
797;"marijuana legalization";"Once it becomes legal you will not be hanging around criminals. So the culture will be VERY different if you have professionals using it responsibly, they won’t have to go to the seedy guy on the corner and pretend to be his friend. That will trickle down to teenagers too, the less shady people to associate with the better.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
167;"marijuana legalization";"this argument is all a matter of what information you choose to acknowledge. for every published piece that says marijuana does less harm to the body then cigarettes, there is a counter-piece that says it does more. it's all propaganda. so how do we decide what the real deal is? compare marijuana to alcohol. it's as simple as that. alcohol is a mind-altering substance. furthermore, while marijuana may make people, at worst paranoid, the general effects are euphoria, a tendency towards laughter, dry mouth, and hunger. alcohol on the other hand causes aggression, disorientation, nausea, vomiting, and even death. and alcohol is legal!!! as for the argument that marijuana is a gateway drug, this is circumstantial at best. as some people have a genetic, chemical imbalance that makes them more prone to alcohol, some people have a genetic potential to be more chemically dependent. only because marijuana is safer, more easily available, and more widely accepted is it the drug that most people start with. in conclusion, make it legal, put the same laws around it that we have for alcohol, and tax the sh*t out of it. it will only add to the economy, as opposed to the millions of dollars the government spends trying to fight the war on drugs, a war that will never be won.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
167;"marijuana legalization";"to make a further argument, one that is not a comparison to alcohol, i will supply this information. the reason marijuana was made illegal was the prevent hemp from becoming the predominant paper product in the world. about a century ago, it was discovered that hemp is a material far superior to wood pulp in the production of paper. however, in order to make the conversion from wood pulp to hemp in the paper mills, owners of the mills would be forced to spend large sums of money to retool their machines. as it so happens, one of the largest paper companies at the time was run by a man who also owned several newspapers. in order to avoid having to spend his profits from the paper mills to make the conversion, he began printing false news articles saying that black people (since this was shortly after the freeing of the slaves and society disdained african americans) were getting high on marijuana and then raping and beating white women. the articles were completely false, but the general public, upon reading these stories was outraged. marches were held on washington, and marijuana was quickly made illegal. this means that hemp could not be grown locally, so importanting it would make it more expensive then local wood pulp for the paper mills, so they were able to maintain their present system and we have been killing trees ever since. what does all this mean in terms of legalization? it means that the negative image of marijuana is one of strictly societal views. science had nothing to do with the decision to make marijuana illegal, and had society not been presented with such a negative illustration of the drug, things would be very very different today. and what does it matter if its legal or not? like i said before, the real difference between the drug being legal or illegal is that, in one manner, legalizing it will bring in funds for the government, where as keeping it illegal will only force the government to expend funds. its simple economics.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
528;"marijuana legalization";"Okay, I’m new here, but I can’t believe this debate is even this close. It’s like listening to a TV commercial. Even the TV commercials, by the way have abandoned most of the opposing arguments. No they just say that marijuana just makes you lazy, very true. Let’s start from the top. A “Gateway Drug” is any drug that leads to other drugs…marijuana is not the first drug for everyone. Sex causes you to lose brain cells, and since when does a stranger or the government have authority over my brain cells. When you say all the “druggies”, does that include the coffee addicts I wade through every morning at work, or the CVS regulars. I thought I heard someone say that marijuana wasn’t less harmful than cigarettes, but that would be crazy. The only reason I would want marijuana to remain illegal is that is shows people and the government for the hypocrites they are. So, “the kids”, being the bright little rays of sunshine they are realize right away that the adults are full of sh*t, and therefore ignore them. The government doesn’t care about your health or mine. My right to choose the drug of my choice shouldn’t be predicated on what some stranger likes and doesn’t like. I don’t like coffee, cigarettes, beer, or marijuana…but I like freedom. Leave me the hell alone with my drugs, like they do you all out there with your purple pills, Viagra, and whatever else you hypocrites out there snort, pop, or inject into your body.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
167;"marijuana legalization";"i smoke marijuana. im not going to lie about it. im not ashamed of it. furthermore, i graduated third in my high school and am attending college on a full ride, where i consistently make the deans list. the people i hang out with who smoke are the top of our class, and some of the smartest people i know and probably smarter then you for making such an ignorant post. furthermore, legalization would decrease price. the price of drugs is based on the ease of importation and the risk involved. eliminate the risk and make production domestic and you have a price reduction. sure, you can try to argue that the government can tax the begeezus out of it, but that would just drive people to grow their own";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1233;"marijuana legalization";"First lets talk about why it should be legalized for pure medical purposes. 1. It serves as a therapeutic drug to patients of cancer and aids. 2. It reduces intraocular pressure in the eye which helps glaucoma patients. 3. New research is showing it can stall or decline the risk of Alzheimers. You cannot compare Marijuana to cigarettes or Alcohol. Scientific research has proven alcohol and cigarettes are unhealthy. There is no scientific consensus of the negative effects marijuana has. Not a single study has shown Marijuana to cause emphysema or lung cancer. If we really want studies to be done on the negative effects Marijuana has (if any), it will be necessary to legalize it so appropriate funding can be achieved along with unbiased perception drug. The illegalization of Marijuana is not about unhealthy side effects. The U.S. government made it illegal way before anyone knew the complications of its side effects. Even today decades after more research is needed. Marijuana is illegal because of false perceptions from anti-drug propaganda, telling us all that Marijuana is a "gateway" drug to criminal behavior. Fear and ignorance creates a debate like this, when in fact to any reasonable people this is common sense. If you think it has negative health effects, than lets have more research done. Both sides will probably agree on this. How can Marijuana get the necessary research when it is illegal?";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1233;"marijuana legalization";"Granted, simply pointing out Marijuana is not as bad as alcohol or cigarettes does not make it perfect excuse to legalize Marijuana. However, If your original argument was Marijuana is illegal because of it's "negative" side effects (which are not scientifically supported at all) this argument is a good one, for obvious reasons. When did it become we need good reasons to legalize something? It has never been like that. We illegalize drugs, or activities because they pose harm to society in someway. Hundreds of millions of dollars is spent to criminalize this drug, not to mention thousands of people put in jail for using it, please do not trivialize this. Show us the harm Marijuana does to society or you have no case for why it is illegal.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1521;"marijuana legalization";"if it was legal I could always get some whenever I wanted.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1662;"marijuana legalization";"It _is_ legal...in my country of origin, and it should stay that way. The only problem is that you cannot make big bucks with it when it is legal.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1307;"marijuana legalization";"First off, I wouldn't say you are a hypocrite for having been a pot smoker and now advocating it being illegal. That being said, the term "gateway drug:" is quite loaded and overused. Studies have shown that for most drug users, alcohol was the first drug they used, and its qualitites as far as reducing inhibitions are well known. Marijuana does not reduce inhibitions, it causes other effects to the brain by affecting serotonin levels, I will leave it to you to remember what you can about its effects. While some studies have suggested that Marijuana effects short-term memory by causing memory loss, other studies have shown that the fat-soluable brain cells it effects can regenerate over time. The important fact is that marijuana has had no recorded deaths (by OD) in its history and should be legalized and regulated in the same way cigs and alcohol is to keep away from children as you are apparently concerned about. Let adults make their own choices as to what to put in their bodies.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1682;"marijuana legalization";"I will give you the point that in many cases marijuana can be a gateway drug that can lead to a user's involvement in other unsavory activities. However, this is caused by a phenomena known as the vice effect. This is the idea that making something that is not innately a negative activity, in the respect that responsible users should not have a negative affect on society, illegal will put this activity in the culture of vice. By making marijuana illegal it pushes it into the domain of criminals and other individuals that have involvement in harder drugs or other illegal activities. This is parallel to how the alcohol business became the domain of gangsters during prohibition. It also relates to the idea that a legalized sex trade would separate prostitution from all of the other negative factors associated with it, drugs, disease, abuse of girls, etc. This is because consenting sex between adults is not innately negative, but since it's illegal, the type of people involved in it tend towards the criminally deviant, and it's illegal status makes it difficult to regulate for safety and hygiene. In closing, it is because marijuana is illegal that it is a gateway drug. I firmly believe that if cigarettes were made illegal today, the same culture of vice would surround it and it too would become a gateway drug. Legalizing marijuana would end the violence and association with harder illegal drugs and lessen it's status as a gateway drug by taking it out of this culture and regulating it more closely.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1219;"marijuana legalization";"For the ignorant people who are still basing their life choices on what they learned in D.A.R.E. class in grade school, marijuana is actually an extremely safe drug/medication. IT DOES NOT KILL BRAIN CELLS. Studies have shown that rather than kill them off, in some situations, the cells become deformed, not die. Cannabis does way more good than harm for medical marijuana patients, who would otherwise have to rely on chemicals created in a lab for medication, with usually serious side effects. Cannabis is actually seen as the cure-all medication by many doctors. Depression, pain, anxiety, asthma, hunger stimulant, confusion, etc., the list just continues. And as far as for recreational use: Government should just tax the hell out of it and regulate it. PROHIBITION DOES NOT WORK! IT ONLY CREATES CRIME!";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
112;"marijuana legalization";"I HAVE JUST ONE THING TO SAY! SMOKE WEED EVERY SINGLE DAY!";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1333;"marijuana legalization";"i wrote this whole thing , took me like an hour , and when i clicked submit, it asked me to sign in , i thought i was signed in but appearently not, so i signed in and the it brought me back to the add argument page without any of my type, i wanted to throw my computer on the floor and do a flying head butt into it";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
270;"marijuana legalization";"Marijuana should be legalized for several reasons. First of these reasons is the fact that it's illegal and its use is still widespread. Another of these reasons is its illegalization. I believe it was in the 1930's that cotton farmers lobbied against marijuana because they were afraid that hemp farmers would outsell their cotton crops because of the fact that hemp is several times stronger and much more durable than cotton. Thus, the cotton farmers used its harmful intoxicating effects to make it illegal and destroy the threat to their industry. Another reason, and of course the most commonly stated of reasons to legalize it, is the fact that alcohol is legal. While Alcohol creates wild effects on people, however, marijuana mellows most people out, and they do less. Also, if used responsibly, it's not a very big health risk. It creates intoxicating effects for a few hours and then wears off. Some people say that marijuana will increase obesity. This is a myth. Many health books state that marijuana will give people the "munchies" and cause them to gain weight, however many people have reported no such weight gain. It relaxes people, and as has been shown has medical uses. Therefore, there is no reason that marijuana, in moderation, should be illegal.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
83;"marijuana legalization";"There is no valid reason for Marijuana to be illegal. State and federal law enforcement agencies have spent too much time, money, manpower on controlling peoples' right to do whatever they choose to do with their own bodies. If individuals have the right to do what they wish unless it infringes on the rights of others to do the same, then a crime is actually defined as an action that causes harm to another person. What crime is committed by ingesting a substance into one's body? There are people in the justice system, (in prison, jail, on probation, or parole), for committing "crimes" related to the possession, use, or sale of drugs, that have not resulted in direct harm to anyone other than that individual. The use of anything by people who are irresponsible "can" be dangerous, but our laws should be made to criminalize the irresponsible behavior, (but only if it causes harm to others), not the thing that a person used while being irresponsible. For example a person driving irresponsibly may cause an accident, but we do not criminalize possession of a vehicle by others due to this, we criminalize the behavior that caused the accident.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1077;"marijuana legalization";"1. Marijuana could be legalized without allowing one to be high while driving, just like alcohol. 2. The worst car accident a person could be involved in while high on pot would be them going 5 MPH and hitting the garage door because they forgot to open it.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
454;"marijuana legalization";"Please explain to me where you got that information.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
329;"marijuana legalization";"I highly suggest you all watch "Penn & Teller's: Bullsh*t!" episode on legalizing drugs.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1233;"marijuana legalization";"It's nice how you use "drug" as a broad term as if all drugs are bad. There are many drugs which the majority of Americans use in their everyday lives to help them live healthier lives. When you say "drugs" be more specific, what drugs are you talking about? I can assure you, Advil or Tylenol are not going to be made illegal anytime soon, even though their drugs have "negative" side effects. If you are talking about marijuana, there is no scientific study showing the marijuana has harmful side-effects. I dont know how many times this has to be said, ciggarettes is not the same as marijuana. Cigarettes is scientifically proven to cause lung cancer, Marijuana has shown no such toxins to do so. Marijuana also has medical benefits. There is no doubt more research is needed to decide which medical benefit works better than the other, or to see if there are negative side effects. In order for the necessary research to be done, Marijuana needs to be legalized. Your argument of "if something" causes deaths it must be illegal", does not hold up. Fast Food Chains, knives, Guns, and other limitless possibilities can cause deaths. Why are those things legal, yet marijuana which has no scientific evidence of a direct harmful side effect illegal? You put yourself in a paradox.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1233;"marijuana legalization";"Your argument is Marijuana should be illegal because it may be unsafe while driving? This argument fails in many ways. For one, If it does have proven negative affects while driving, alcohol is a case closed example of a drug that has negative affects on driving yet remains legal. There are also many drugs Americans take everyday which are not safe to take while driving (sleeping pills) Any drug that impairs your vision or your ability to react to situations negatively is unsafe while driving. So now any drugs that does this should be illegal? I don't think many doctors will agree with you on this. Please rebuttal my comment, I am trying really hard to see how this justifies Marijuana being Illegal. It is terrible anytime someone drives recklessly, whether because of sleepiness, distractions, or drugs. It is even more horrible when kids die because of it. This is why it should be illegal to drive under these conditions, instead of illegal to take the drug plainly.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1233;"marijuana legalization";"As I have mentioned earlier, never has it been we need "good reasons" to make things legal. Either this drug is harmful to society that making it legal would have great negative side effects (This was the original reasons for it being made illegal) or this drug should be legal. If a drastically more harmful drug (as you admitted) is legalized, than the argument of marijuana being illegalized because of negative side affects is destroyed. I ask again, what is the reason for marijuana being illegal? Society does not make things illegal by default, than wait for excellent reasons for it to be legal. Indeed, this is just a weakness in your argument. It seems you are intellectually bankrupt for why Marijuana is illegal in the first place. The questions we should be asking is not what good reasons are there for marijuana to be legal (although there are many), the question should be instead why was it made illegal in the first place? Were these reasons justified? Are the resources (government spending) and punishment (jail time) worth it?";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1688;"marijuana legalization";"Well, alcohol is legal but you're not allowed to drive while being under the influence of it. Why would it be difference for pot? I say treat weed like any other legal, mind-altering substance.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1675;"marijuana legalization";"Here are some facts, i can provide sources if needed. Some of these are new, others have been touched upon before. 1. The DEA opperates on a 20 billion a year budget, when you enclude all other drug enforcement activity you find that the drug war costs roughly 70 billion a year. 2. Although we throw more and more money at the problem, drugs are stronger, cheaper, and easier to find than they have ever been. High School students can get weed easier than alchohol, all because a drug dealer doesn't check ID's like the corner liquor store. 3. Of all drug related arrests, 80% are for marijuana possesion (not the sale or transport of). 4. Nearly 60% of prison inmates are there for drug possesion (it cost's nearly $1,700 a day to support a prison inmate). 5. The "gateway effect" is a result of marijuana users being introduced to harder drugs by the dealer, if pot were sold legally these harder drugs would not be so readily available. 6. Just like in prohibition, the drug war has fueled the growth of gangs and black markets who have no legal means to settle disputes. 7. Drug prohibition creates police corruption because of the vast amount of money that can be gained from drugs. 8. Studies in Amsterdam, where pot is legal, show that legalisation has led to a decline in use. 9. Driving studies conducted in real traffic in Amsterdam have shown that a person who is high cannot reach the level of impairment of a person who is at the legal limit for alchohol. 10. Marijuana doesn't kill brain cells, that study has been debunked because the researches didn't use propper science. Nor do braincells become deformed, although a rewiring of the brain has been shown. 11. Marijuana has shown no cancer causing effects, it is now widely believed that nicotine, not carcinogens, is the main promoter of cancer. Also, weed has shown the possibility of killing cancer cells. 12. Most anti-marijuana research and advertisement is funded by Phillip Morris (and other corporations). We all know that PM sells ciggarettes (and weed could hurt their sales) but PM also owns oil companies (MJ can be used as a fuel and could replace many products made with petroleum such as plastics, canvas, etc.). Also, marijuana could be used to create better paper cheaper and end the deforestation caused by paper production.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

450;"marijuana legalization";"Marihuana was legal in the US until 1937 and it was outlawed in great part due to racism against Blacks, jazz and blues musicians, their followers and migrant Mexican workers. This ocurred after the worse phase of US history, Prohibition which gave rise to organized crime, a penalty we are stil paying for today. Cannibas is an anti-biotic and has been used around the world for over 5,000 years. Jon Jax 71";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
797;"marijuana legalization";"So your saying that the only reason you don't get high then drive is cause its against the law? Thats VERY VERY shallow. Anyways, Just because we legalize it doesn't mean that we make it legal to drive while high. Its the same as drinking. It's a very silly argument that you make. Legalize doesn't mean non-regulated. Ohh and i don't smoke, cigarettes or pot. And even if it were legal i still wouldn't.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
375;"marijuana legalization";"""not as bad as alcohol" isn't a reason to make it legal..." Yes it is. According to the controlled substances act, a drug can only be schedule I if there is 1) no acceptable medical use 2) a high risk of PHYSICAL dependency 3) a high potential for abuse. Marijuana does not meet 1&2, thus should be at LEAST schedule III. Second of all, congress draws power for the controlled substance act from the commerce clause of the constitution- giving congress the power to regulate INTERSTATE commerce. If you grow the plant in your home for private use than it is neither INTERSTATE nor COMMERCE. Third, the constitution states all powers not expressly granted to congress are within the state's power. Congress had to get a CONSTITUTIONAL amendment in order to ban alcohol. Why was another such amendment NOT NEEDED to ban marijuana (or any other drug)? Fourth, the 18th amendment was repealed, meaning that congress does not have the power to ban intoxicating liquors- which marijuana TEA would qualify as. Marijuana overdose has never caused a single recorded death. We get more deaths from rollercoasters, sex, or choking on chicken bones. There are even cases of death from caffeeine. No one is suggesting that this be allowed while driving or during work. Grow up and drop that arguement.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
375;"marijuana legalization";"Marijuana has more carthinigens, but niccotine closes your lung passageways to make those lesser carthinogens MORE dangerous to the lungs. It is also physically addictive. Just because something is in our culture doesn't mean it shouldn't be made illegal. Witch burnings were once part of our culture too. As far as marijuana, we can make that illegal. Why not knitting as well? People who knit are more likely to be obese than people who jog instead. Obesity is bad. Thus knitting should be outlawed. Let's get rid of TV too- it's bad for your eyes. Let's get rid of everything and keep people in Matrix-style feeding tubes to ensure maximum biological lifespan. Its my choice, no one should be on me about it!";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
375;"marijuana legalization";"Gateway drugs. I hate gateway drugs. Milk for example. You know most people who take heroin once drank milk. Milk is therefore a gateway to heroin. Oh yeah, and sex. Sex is a gateway drug. Most heroin addicts also engage in sex. Therefore sex causes heroin addiction. It's rediculous to think that because the heroin addict started with something relatively harmless that he would not have eventually gotten to heroin without the pot. I myself did ecstasy without ever doing marijuana. It wasn't a gateway drug. I just had that mindset. Besides, no one's talking about giving weed to children, just like kids can drink, smoke, or have sex legally. We're talking about adults over the legal age of consent.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
375;"marijuana legalization";"Why marijuana should be legal. 1) marijuana use does not harm the person not smoking it. 2) I am fully aware of the dangers of marijuana use to myself. 3) If I choose to take a personal risk for personal pleasure, that is my choice- just as I risk a car crash when I drive, or a roller coaster accident when I go to the theme park. Thus marijuana should be my own choice. Not to take while driving or give to children, but to consume privately for my own amusement. Cheese contains cholesterol, which leads to many obesity related problems, such as heart attacks. But some people choose to take that risk and eat cheese anyway, for no other reason but that they enjoy the taste. Who am I to say they can't?";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1703;"marijuana legalization";"Eating pizza is also a hazard to my health. Why don't we just ban pizza too? While we're at it, why don't we just ban fast food in general? Heart attack and heart failure from high cholesterol is the number one killer in America. Marijuana is a recreational drug. Like with all things that change how your body functions, you have to do it responsibly. It's like how you have to be responsible when you drink. You can drink, but don't drink and drive. You can smoke, but don't smoke and drive. It is otherwise harmless. The effects of marijuana are simply for pleasure. It is non addictive (less addictive than cigarettes or alcohol) and just there for a good time, stress reliever, it even has medical purposes. I say make it legal, but warn people about the hazards. Kind of like the "[insert thing here] is my anti-drug" campaign.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
375;"marijuana legalization";""THS is a mild form of acid, or LSD." --- No it's not. LSD is a chemically created compound formed from wheat ergot, while THC is a naturally occuring drug in the marijuana plant. LSD is untraceable in drug tests because it leaves your system so quickly, and users build up hypertolerence to it. Marijuana stays in your blood for weeks and hair for months. LSD lasts 7-12 hours when eaten. Marijuana has almost no effect when eaten (unless dosage is extremely increased) and then lasts for 2-3 hours. LSD includes emotional changes, hallucinations (open eyed) and confusion, dementia, etc. Marijuana causes relaxation, some (rare) closed eye visuals, and slight confusion (due to lack of attention) If anything, SALVIA DIVINORUM is more like a weak form of LSD- and Salvia is legal to smoke to get high, by the way.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1655;"marijuana legalization";"Im not sure if this is correct, but i view weed as a gateway drug partially because of its illegallity itself, and because of the way it is sold in the same manner as the more extreme and dangerous illegal drugs. it is not the nature of the drug that makes it a gateway, but the manner in which it is portrayed and distributed to the public (the drug dealer). so therefore, if the public was aware of true nature of marijuana (and it was legalized), we would not only have the economic benefit on our side (as mentioned before) but pot would become safer to use in more ways then just the risk of contaminents, and the "gateway" effect would lessen greatly. this, of course, isn't even to mention the medicinal properties that weed can offer. im not really sure of specifics, but do think that a good reason it's not being accepted more widely is purely because of it's bad publicity and not because of its ineffectiveness.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1678;"marijuana legalization";"I'm not sure how legalization could facilitate teens gaining access to it. The fact is that the average 13 year old can get "pot" much easier than they can get alcahol or cigarettes. Simple reason, drug dealers don't care who they sell to. Store clerks are faced with huge fines and possible jail time for selling alcahol or cigarrettes to minors. By legalizing it, the black market is effectively out of business. There just won't be a profit in it anymore. As far as car accidents, you apply the same rules as Driving under the influence of Alcahol. Thirdly, as far as the drug lords go, once it's legal, there's no reason to smuggle it, when it can be delivered by truck right to the store. It takes the profit margin away from the drug dealer, and gives it to a farmer. Most of the arguements against legalization I see here are based on moral indignation. The problem is that everyone's morals are different. You cannot force someone else to live by your moral code. If that was legal, I would have outlawed rap music years ago, because of my morals. Also, the Government has no right to try to protect people from the consequences of their own actions.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

I'm pretty sure we can thank mary for some of the great art and design we have today. Should it be Legalized? Yes it should be. Probably would get rid of a nice chunk of the deficit ...

William Davis -------------------------------------------------------------------------- PREFACE Before the Gatewood Galbraith for Governor Campaign in 1991, few Kentuckians knew that the plant that the federal government had demonized for over 50 years as "Marijuana - Assassin of Youth," was, in fact, Cannabis Hemp, the most traded commodity in the world until the mid-1800s, and our state's number one crop, industry, and most important source of revenue, for over 150 years. Today, thanks to the efforts of pioneer hemp researchers and public advocates such as Galbraith, Jack Fraizer, Jack Herer, Chris Conrad, Ed Rosenthal, Don Wirtshafter and others, the federal government's unjustifiable suppression of our state's right to develop our most valuable and versatile natural resource, is facing increasing opposition from an informed public. Hemp is now recognized as the number one agriculturally renewable raw material in the world, and perhaps the only crop / industry which can guarantee us industrial and economic independence from the trans-national corporations. "Shadow of the Swastika" is a follow-up to my earlier work, "Cannabis Hemp: the Invisible Prohibition Revealed," which I wrote and published in support of the Galbraith Campaign. Since publication of that booklet, there has been growing public acceptance of the evidence that Marijuana Prohibition was created in 1937, not to protect society from the "evils of the drug Marijuana," as the Federal government claimed, but as an act of deliberate economic and industrial sabotage against the re-emerging Industrial Hemp Industry. Previous investigations by hemp researchers have been limited to the suppression of free-market competition from the hemp industry, and focused on the activities of three prominent members of America's corporate, industrial and banking establishment during the mid- to late-1930s: WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST, the newspaper and magazine tycoon. The expected rebirth of cannabis hemp as a less expensive source of pulp for paper meant his millions of acres of prime timberland, and investment in wood pulp papermaking equipment, would soon be worth much less. In the 1920s, about the same time as the equipment was developed to economically mass-produce raw hemp into pulp and fiber for paper, he began the "Reefer Madness" hoax in his newspaper and magazine publications. ANDREW MELLON, founder of the Gulf Oil Corporation. He knew that cannabis hemp was an alternative industrial raw material for the production of thousands of products, including fuel and plastics, which, if allowed to compete in the free-market, would threaten the future profits of the oil companies. As Secretary of the Treasury he created the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, and appointed his own future nephew-in-law, Harry Anslinger, as director. Anslinger would later use the sensational, and totally fabricated, articles published by Hearst, to push the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 through Congress, which successfully destroyed the rebirth of the cannabis hemp industry. A prominent member of one Congressional subcommittee who voted in favor of this bill was Joseph Guffey of Pennsylvania, an oil tycoon and former business partner of Andrew Mellon in the Spindletop oil fields in Texas. THE DU PONT CHEMICAL CORPORATION, which owned the patents on synthetic petrochemicals and industrial processes that promised billions of dollars in future profits from the sale of wood pulp paper, lead additives for gasoline, synthetic fibers and plastics, if hemp could be suppressed. At the time, du Pont family influence in both government and the private sector was unmatched, according to historians and journalists. This publication, however, reveals documented historical evidence that the suppression of the hemp industry was only one key part of a much larger conspiracy in the 1930s, not only by the three corporate interests named above, but by many others, as well. Congressional records, FBI reports and investigations by the Justice Department, during the 1930s and 1940s, have already documented evidence of this wider plot. A list of the corporations named include Du Pont, Standard Oil, and General Motors, all of which were proven to be conspiring with Nazi industrial cartels to eliminate competition world-wide and divide among themselves the Earth's industrial resources and commercial markets, for profitable exploitation. This conspiracy succeeded. It is now obvious that this lack of serious competition in the industrial raw materials market caused our present - and totally contrived - addiction to petrochemicals. Its success is directly responsible for the most troubling problems we now face in the 1990s, serious damage to our environment, concentration of economic and political power into fewer and fewer hands, and the weakening of the rights of individuals and states to determine their own futures. It is more and more evident that, given the historical record, the structure of the New World Order is being built upon the Foundation of Marijuana Prohibition, and only the relegalization of free-market hemp competition can save us.

1233;"marijuana legalization";"Most of those claims you made are completely baseless. The only study I have seen showing links to marijuana to killing brain cells were those in the 1970's. Many studies today have shown Marijuana has no negative side effects. Marijuana can deform brain cells, but it does not kill them, nor has the deformity shown proven links to negative side effects. Marijuana does not caus any psychological disorders. You are confusing marijuana with LSD. Marijuana is actually a great stress reliever, so it is actually good for depression if you are suffering from stress anxiety. Marijuana also does not lower your immune system, you are confusing Marijuana with Alcohol. Marijuana is known for helping the immune system, it is actually recommended for patients with cancer and aids (Check out the Harvard studies). Are we now illegallizing marijuana because people can commit fatal accidents while using it? How many people commit fatal accidents with guns, knives, alcohol etc.. You are really grasping straws here. No one is denying Marijuana can cause fatal accidents. There are thousands of things that can cause accidental deaths, yet they somehow remain legal. If marijuana were to be legalized, you would be taking away a major product the drug dealers use. It would cripple their underground market. Look at what happened when alcohol was legalized, the underground market selling it was ran out of business, or had to adapt to a new illegal product. (Either way the crime is no longer linked to alcohol). Drugs or drug dealers do not cause poverty. Rather Drug dealers are a result of poverty or the taking advantage of people in poverty. These drug wars are not exclusive to poverty. Check out a city like Detroit where poverty is getting really high, but illegal drug activity is down. There is no jobs there, so there is no market for the drug dealers to sell their drugs to. Evidence for poverty or crime rate among drug dealers is not evidence for marijuana to remain illegal. If we were to make alcohol illegal, we would see the same thing happen. Make any product illegal and the underground market will take advantage of it.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
167;"marijuana legalization";"congratulations!!!! you have quite possibly posted the most unintelligent and uninformed post of the ENTIRE debate! let's break it down. but first i have a question, did you read anything ANYONE posted before you decided to throw your stupidity at the world? i didn't think so now, i do not understand how legalizing a substance is going to in and of itself encourage more people to try it. people do not smoke cigarettes simply because they are legal, they smoke them because they want to. therefore, regardless if marijuana is legal or not, the people who want to use it are going to use it, and the people who choose otherwise will do so as well. there isn't going to be an incredible surge in the percentage of people using. next point, as i said in about 4 previous posts, for every "proven fact" you find about how many brain cells you lose, there is the exact same amount of "proven facts" about how little harm it does. STATISTICS LIE! they can be skewed to deliver the message you want them to. so just forget the so-called "facts." furthermore, you say marijuana kills. do cigarettes kill? you might answer, "yes, they give you cancer, of course they do." then tell me court after court after court rules that cigarettes do not give you cancer, they only increase the risk of cancer. it is not a scientific fact that smoking ANY substance causes cancer, it only increases the likelihood (i'm only speaking legally here). now, here is where your argument is completely annihilated. first off, marijuana doesn't come from South America. some comes from Mexico, but the majority comes from Canada. how aboot that? our northern neighbors are the ones getting us high. shocking, i know. so let's talk about your so called drug lords. this is the main reason legalization works. you make this a freely traded commodity, guess what? farmer joe starts growing domestically. what effect does that have? well, for one, its going to make farmer joe a rich man, and furthermore, its going to eliminate the market for your so-called "drug-lords." how does this work, you might ask. well, here's how. the majority of the price of illegal drugs is derived based on the risk involved plus the price of production. price of production is equal, and can even be reduced if scale of production is increased. so let's work this out mathematically. X=risk ad Y=production cost. in an illegal market X+Y=N, where N is the final price of the product. now, in a legal marker X, or risk, is eliminated, because there is no need to run borders and there is no chance to get apprehended and imprisoned, so therefore, our equation is now Y=Z, where Z is the final cost of the product and must be less then N, because we know that the sum of a variable, plus another positive variable, must be greater then the original variable alone. therefore, everything you took the time to rant and rave about is uninformed, incorrect, misconceived, poorly argued, and just plain dumb. thank you and good night.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

1342;"marijuana legalization";"In spite of what thomasa93 said about getting behind the wheel of a vehicle after smoking it, why don't you try it? You will soon find out that you feel no reason to do anything except sit there and just talk about the most pointless of topics. Also, just because judgement is slightly impaired doesnt mean you are plain stupid. Most, possibly everyone who is high from weed knows it. They know they should not be getting behind the wheel. While there is evidence that suggests that the usage of marijuana does impair reaction times and would increase the risk of car crashes, I have yet to hear or read about (even after doing a search) a car accident directly caused by marijuana. However, as I said before, the incentive to do anything requiring effort such as driving a vehicle is not all that appealing to those after they have just smoked. Looking at it from another side, there are HUNDREDS of activities that can cause a car accident if done while driving, and most of them are legal. Lets see, eating, smoking tobacco, cellular phones, conversations with the driver, playing with the radio, those kids in the minivan fighting over space and kicking the drivers seat, animals in the vehicle, trying to shoo that fly away, picking up that item that was dropped on the floor, I can go on. Now, on to the broader area of the topic: should it be legal? Well, lets say it is. Well, for one things, crime rate and violence will go down. Looking from a logical standpoint, their will be 13,000,000 less criminals, their will be less violence due to the illegal trade of drugs, it will cost taxpayers about 12 billion dollars less annually to keep those solely jailed for the possession of the drug. It would also be a gateway for tax revenue. Just like cigarettes, weed can be taxed like crazy. How about a few more things about the drug? Well, lets start off by saying that unless you inject or consume a large amount (42 mg/kg for 50 percent of rats tested) of pure THC into your body at one, which in all reality is an impossible amount to achieve if it is smoked or ingested (one, its not cost effective, and two it is a lot of weed as marijuana by volume is on average 7-10 percent THC), and because of those numbers, there are no reported or even confirmed deaths directly related to marijuana. Keeping it illegal, who knows what growers are using as a fertilizer and an insecticide. Making it legal would also mean setting standards on how this is safely done, which in theory would make it even more beneficial than it already is. Marijuana is also said to have many medicinal uses as well. Coming right from WebMD, it is said that THC is a preventive and a treatment for hardened and stiff arteries. It helps alleviate high intraocular pressure. If intraocular pressure gets to high levels, it can cause permanent eye damage, even blindness. It is less addictive than caffeine. In fact, there is very little reports of actual addictions. Most addicts are the type that tend to have an addictive personality. Some other things to add. Some people feel that using marijuana is morally bad. If anyone here feels this way, be sure to say how. And when you do, make sure you don't say because its illegal, as that is a bad excuse. Also, tell me, how are your morals better than mine? By you or anyone saying "I think that is morally wrong, therefore it should be illegal" tells me that they think they feel that their morals and opinions count more than anyone else's. Morality is a relative term: what I think is moral may not be with the guy sitting next to me on the bus. This actually turned out much longer than I planned.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

Since consumers of marijuana are forced to obtain the substance through illegal means, they consort with criminals. This creates a direct link between marijuana users and other drugs. Furthermore, there is no conclusive evidence that marujuana kills brain cells exclusivly. In addition the two trials conducted by the Food and Drug administration determined marijuana to be a drug safe enough for human consumption Several books have been published such as Marijuana Revisited that define psychological and medical benefits of the drug. Cancer patients have used it to deal with pain, and nausea of chemotherapy. Post-traumatic stress disorder patients have also used it with positive results. Using this drug medically provides an alternative to those who do not repond well to pain killers, anti-depressants, or chemo drugs. By legalizing this drug we will also eradicate the underground economy its prohibition creates. The government will regulate marijuana which they can collect taxes on. The drug will be available in safer environments preventing the "gateway drug" effect.

The criminal element would be removed. And respect for the law could only increase, as some level of rationality was infused. 2. Kids should have less access to weed. I agree. Legalization and regulation (again, akin to beer) renders underage access LESS likely than it is now - you wouldn't have "criminals" trying to sell pot to kids.

Weed compared to alcohol and tobacco is actually the healthiest alternitive. Have you ever heard of an 'angry high'? or people killing someone for looking at you funny while your stoned? No, and weed doesnt contain harmful chemicals that the tobacco companies put into their prouduct to make them more addicting to the consumer. Tobacco freashly grown and not altered in any way from when it was harvested and dried actually can be good for your health, but so can weed. Weed slows the growth of cancer cells, thats why terminally ill cancer paitents can get medician marijuana, it gives them more time. Now lets look at this at an economic standpoint. The government regulates alcohol, by putting taxes on it. They make money when you drink. People smoke weed regardless if its legal or not. If they were smart they could legalize weed, and control the flow of it. They could grow their own and sell it like alcohol and make a profit from it. They could use this extra money to do something useful such as finding the cure for cancer, or putting it into education, so our educators can be suficiently paid, and with proper teaching equipment. Then we could turn around and make many scientific discoveries, boost the United States economy as well as our technology. And even if they put some restrictions on it such as, not driving under the influence, that would still be acceptable, because even though driving stoned isnt that big of a problem, some people would feel better about that, and it would cause a bill to legalize it to pass more easily.

Why, because i we And friends abound, truly believe, the affectionately named, Mary Jane, should be used for what it is intended for,. And If Your Literate enough you KNOW the benefits of it's use, We Said Use! not abuse! Anything NOT used in moderation is abuse!!!! No One should smoke themselves into overuse, No One!!!! For MANY Reason The Herb Should be government controlled, TAXED just like cigarettes and liquors to say the least, any one that that truly wants to use it, or truly needs it for all it's good benefits,,,should be able to legally purchase it anywhere the government would allow it to be sold. In Our Nation the USA - No one should have a freedom of speech or freedom of choice taken away, no rather we as a - supposed free world nation we should be allowed to use the herb as needed. There are even private government journals, oh yes there is - if one digs enough,,,that truly tell of the herbs natural benefits,,,even more so the industrial use of the herb, yes even hemp, is an awesome market virtually untapped.

Probably not - especially if your not the GOD believer you should be...Maybe if it were explained to you, in full you might become enlightened, instead of dumbed down,.

None of them have been scientifically proven. Propaganda from decades ago has become a mainstay in our country's politics. Way back when not much was known about hard drugs such as cocaine, LSD, heroin, and many others. Yet our government decided that a "war on drugs" seemed like the right thing to do. So they went ahead and lumped marijuana with the truly lethal drugs such cocaine and heroin. Thus the stigma towards marijuana was born. Nowadays we are seeing that stigma slowly fade away as marijuana is being closely researched (but this research is being hampered by the government mind you) by scientists to figure out the possible medical uses for marijuana. I would also like to point out that not only "hippies" use marijuana. Marijuana users vary greatly from customer service employees to business executives. As the propaganda fades into the distance and cold hard facts start to be released to the general public, I am confident marijuana will be legalized in due time. Oh yeah, and I forgot to mention this but I don't smoke marijuana. It's a personal life choice. Don't really think it would benefit me.

Have you ever smoked it before? because what you're saying sounds like you've been convinced by mere propaganda instead of trying it yourself and making an intelligent, informed decision. Look, I'm not saying that it's impossible to get addicted to weed, it is, but I've never heard of anybody getting addicted to it after several uses, as you claim, let alone 1 use. Do me a favor and try some mate, if you don't like it then you don't have to do it, The only reason marijuana isn't legal now is because society and propaganda have warped it into something that they portray as being unstable, highly unsocial and typical of unproductive, unskilled people who just sit around all day, not contributing to society. If half the people who speak about how awful marijuana is actually tried it and made an informed decision of how dangerous it is, I'm sure it would be legal and become far less of a social taboo than other mind-altering substances such as alchohol, in my opinion, the prospect that it is illegal is an injustice of great proportions, and should be fixed as soon as possible. Think about it, as stated several times before, the economic viewpoint of legalizing marijuana in the United States alone is indeed very good, as, if taxed wisely, could generate tax revenues of up to 6 billion dollars each year, added to that would be the money taken out of propaganda to try to ban it's use, And by the way, your point that 'It makes drug lords rich and users poor.' is obsolete, as if it was in fact legalized, then it would be legal and drug lords wouldn't be in its production, they would then move on of course to harder stuff, such as heroine, ecstasy, cocaine etc.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

But hey, that's just my opinion. And typing in sarcasm is like flipping someone off over the phone. I think that legalization would get rid of the black markets and the crime involved with them(as froggyj4 has already said) but it should not be an easily obtainable substance as cancer sticks are. Walk down to any supermarket and you can get smokes. That just makes things way too easy. The medical marijuana clinics are going up (at least around here in LA county) but they're used for honest medical purposes - not just anyone can get in. That's a good idea there, but they should have it to where anyone of legal age (21 i think?) can come in, and have something checked for background history of abuse. It'd be cool if there was some way they could hold the user there untill they're sober, but that's never going to happen, what with laws about holding people against their will.

Lots!! Governments are pathetic, they say cigarettes and alcohol are bad, but love collecting the tax money they get don't they? If the government really cared they would just ban cigarettes, why don't they do that? They are more addicting than Marijuana. And most of the people against Marijuana have probably never tried it so you don't even know what it's like, it's not crack or meth or heroin people it's pot!

It cost way to much money to enforce and not to mention time. It would also give the government something else it can tax and they can profit off of it.

Another plus would be that when something becomes more accessible, it usually becomes less desirable, especially by young adults. Not all the time, but usually. I am the good girl.

Freedom is what makes this country special. Yes pot can cause cancer, but if you smoke pot there no way you could increase your neigbors chance for cancer. So what's the problem, if you feel that your goverment should protect you from yourself then I can understand your points.

However, when we look at the Netherlands which has basically legalized cannabis use, that figure is more than cut in half at 9.5%. Another reason why it should be legalized is that it creates an unnecessary brand of criminal. A person may get caught in the process of a marijuana exchange and get sent to jail. This person now has a criminal record, making it extremely difficult for them to get a job, they then have nowhere to turn to, but back to selling drugs, and turning more youth into future versions of themselves.

Legalize it, and it becomes part of a competing market without the need to engage in illegal smuggling and thousands upon thousands of deaths.

1659;"marijuana legalization";"For those of you that think it will never be legal than you should know that the government send a monthly supply to a select few who was involved in earlier research for treating them for medical conditions. That right there should tell you that it will be legalized. When? Not sure but I believe that everyone deserves to be pain free and there are many health conditions that this GOD made herb can treat. Ppl die everyday from alcohol included many innocent ppl who were killed by drunk drivers. Also many ppl die everyday from cigarettes. Both of this drugs are brain alerting so don't give us that BS. Also this 2 drugs are extremely addictive which is why we have AA and millions can NOT get over their addiction with cigarettes. Seen it time and time again someone trying to quit smoking and only going a few days and then pick it right back up yet I have seen tons of ppl to go without smoking marijuana for months and alot of times even many yrs without smoking mj without craving it like ppl do with cigarettes and alcohol. I have also seen the violent effects that alcohol causes thats why there are so many bar fights, many domestic violent victims, and children abused everyday. Mj is a great medicinal treatment for those living with debilitating pain everyday of their lives becoz of health conditions and mj is the only and safest thing to treat their pain. It's great for anorexia and cancer patients having to take chemo, it makes them have the munchies. Also it is scientific fact that the intake of thc can reduce the growth of cancer. It's also useful for cataracts, arthritis, spinal injuries, fibromyalgia, MS, anxiety, asthma, and many other health conditions. This is just a very few uses of mj. There is also other great uses of hemp in fact the ropes used on in world war 2 was actually made of hemp. There are health benefits from the intake of hemp oil. And even better is how hemp can be made into fuel helping our country from having to rely on other countries for a fuel. The fuel made of hemp is also much more eco-friendly helping our world from continuing to cause global warming. Hemp can also be made into paper and grows much faster which would also help from causing more global warming. Wow why is mj illegal well we would have to go back to when Richard Nixon was president. You see he paid the government paid scientist to lie about the effect of mj when he used monkeys to experiment on the health effects on humans using mj. The testing went like this, the scientist took monkeys and put gas masks on each of them and pumped their lungs with the amount of 500 joints in about 5 minutes causing the monkeys to suffocate. Hmm 500 joints? Is that possible for someone to consume that much within 5 minutes? HELL NO it is NOT possible. In fact, the individuals that are medicating themselves using marijuana for health conditions usually only need a small amount to take the effect of pain relief and stress reduction. Not even 1 joint is needed to be consumed to to treat most health conditions. Another funny BS lie that the government wants you to think is that mj causes permanent brain damage. This to has been proven to be false. After sometime of no mj consumption the brain effects actually become reversed unlike when you smoke cigarettes that are full of man made chemicals including arsenic. Arsenic? WTF? Wow that's smart. Arsenic is a poison that is used to kill unwanted pests. And you idiots want us to believe that it is safer than smoking mj. HAHA the joke is on you. The point is mj should be regulated this is true. That way it gives ppl a safe way of getting much needed medicine to the ppl that need it. Especially since a good portion of elderly are now smoking to treat their medical conditions. And if you look at the time that mj was popular in the 60's that means that a good % of these elderly folks were smoking it for recreational purposes. Most in fact stopped smoking to raise their children and now is looking back at the benefits of smoking and realizing that it is so much safer than using pain meds to treat for pain. Oh and btw pain meds are very addictive as well but causes many deaths from overdoses and they have many horrible side effects including making you unable to have a normal life. Mj has side effects also, I know, they are having the munchies, being sexual aroused, and some cause sleepiness but doesn't prevent you from living a normal life. In fact for those who live in pain they can go from hurting so bad they can't move to being energetic and able to still function like an individual who doesn't smoke. Think of it this way, to be pain free and able to work they need to consume mj to function like you without smoking. So after all of this unknown research facts for those of you who have never touched the stuff now you know the some of the benefits for the medicinal use of marijuana. Stop telling ppl what our drs can or cannot use to treat medical conditions. Thought this was a free country. Doesn't sound like one at all. In fact, we are controlled by the government who sadly feeds us one lie after another. I know you republican will say that's not true but your also they ones that want to kill off the poor so you will have more $$$. Funny if you would get your hands off of everyone's $$$ and listen to the ones that have done the research you would realize legalizing the use of marijuana would do a hell of a lot more good than bad.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

In contrast to alcohol, which tends to increase risky driving practices, marijuana tends to make subjects more cautious. Surveys of fatally injured drivers show that when THC is detected in the blood, alcohol is almost always detected as well. For some individuals, marijuana may play a role in bad driving. The overall rate of highway accidents appears not to be significantly affected by marijuana's widespread use in society.

Another thing if you look at the history cocaine use to be legal and was in the recipe for coca-cola. With your comment about marijuana is illegal so therefore it should stay that way, I guess you believe that cocaine was once legal so therefore it should have stayed that way. Oh and don't forget the fact that marijuana was also legal until the 20th century when it was made illegal so with this said marijuana was legal at a time and so therefore should be legal now. Wow aren't you the intelligent one";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

Just like it is difficult to get your dr to give out pain pills to someone in severe pain. Sadly the drug addicts now how to get the drs to write the script but those of us with real physical pain can't get a script for anything more than a weak muscle relaxer. My mothere and I are both affected by this. We have fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative arthritis, migraines, severe back pain and most days can hardly get out of our beds due to our pain but since marijuana is illegal here all together we can NOT get it prescribed to us. In the 20+ yrs trying to find something for pain relief the only thing that has helped is marijuana and btw smoking marijuana is not the only way of consuming it. There are vaporizors, oils, and it can also be ingested in foods. LEGALIZATION OF MEDICINAL MARIJUANA IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE REASONS";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

Also know many smokers who also can tell you that they have never had a hallucinogen experience from smoking marijuana so why don't you try to use some info you have found that doesn't come from the lies that were given to make it illegal in the first and by researchers that are not paid by the government. Let's see if you can come up with anything that makes sense. You all on the opposing argument have been weak";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

1651;"marijuana legalization";"If the goal is to keep people from harming themselves by smoking marijuana, keeping it illegal will never do this. If you think marijuana users are criminals, it is only because using it is illegal. I think that people might just get bored of it if they made it legal. If someone tells you that marijuana eases their suffering, who are you to say sorry its bad, you are just going to have to suffer.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
870;"marijuana legalization";"First of all, Marijuana doesn't affect your health as much as smoking does. Smoking kills. The least marijuana can do is give you brain damage (from overuse). Studies have shown that Amsterdam (who legalizes marijunana) have less people using it than say the States where people are taking it for the 'fun of it' seeing as it is a thrill to some to do things illegally. We only sell cigarettes mainly because the government can tax it thus earn more money. Selling Marijuana over-the-counter can reduce the number of people taking it as they could have an official stamp to record your purchases. So, people can have a limited amount of the drug in a week. Obviously, only people aged 18+ will be able to purchase it like alcohol, seeing as the effects of marijuana are greater to the minors.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

Arguement 1 -Think of all the stoners in prisen taking up federal funding that would not be there if Pot was legal. Arguement 2 -How about taxing Weed and using it to pay off some of Americas debt? Arguement 3-Americas agencies are spending billions of dollers fighting the war agenst drugs, when, if it was legal, they wouldn't have to, just sell it themselves. Sure they would still have to worry about other drugs, but Marijuana is not just a gate-way drug, it is also one of the most popular. In conclusion, the government should legalize it, but tax it and put the same, if not more, restrictions on it as alchohol.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1704;"marijuana legalization";"My point here is to address the argument that marijuana is bad for you therefore should be illegal. Now I am not saying that marijuana is good for you because there is evidence to suggest it is not, but my argument is - so what if it is not good for you? It is a personal choice, it is up to you to choose whether you risk harming yourself for the experience of smoking marijuana, just as it is your choice to harm yourself by drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, eating fast food, watching hour after hour of television. Would you arrest people who have tried to commit suicide? Surely that's more detrimental to their health than smoking weed. This arbitrary allocation of laws is not rational or logical, I would like to hear arguments as to why marijuana should remain illegal without mentioning health implications.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
504;"marijuana legalization";"Yes, the laws cost a fortune and don't work. The people that want to do drugs don't care that it's illegal. The people that don't want to screw up their lives won't do the drugs if they are legal. I hear people say it will be more available if it were legal.

I know many athletes that use the herb recreationally and dont suffer many consequences from it. one notorious athlete that smoked weed was Ricky Williams that former running back for the miami dolphins. Although he is not in the league anymore because of that sole reason, it did not affect his play. Can you say the same for cigarettes? Now, if marijuana somehow did get legalized, the government will benefit most from it because they can put a tax on it which would reduce a good amount of their debt. It would also discourage cartels and smugglers trying to smuggle marijuana into the country because it will be legal. This will save the government money and personel that are trying to keep marijuana out of this country.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"

Well, i mean not buy from every "gangster" you see in the alley, buy from a store or something. And if they do legalize it, well, i do not know if i am right but i think economy is gonna be better, with the exports/imports, maybe they stop making it from Columbia or alike, making it in, like, Ohio, places around it. Lots of farms. And well, drug lords are illegal, those must be punished but... i do not know. Let them decide.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1647;"marijuana legalization";"Find one case in history that a person was killed directly by marijuana. You can't. Saying it kills people is a flat out lie. It currently makes drug lords rich because of the laws against it. History shows us that the demand for any product will be met regardless what is written in law. Our laws only ensure that the criminal drug cartels get the money instead of our own american entrepreneurs. If killing people is your argument then what about all the deaths at the U.S./Mexican borders as a result of the drug trade being criminalized. What about the children that get caught up in crossfire over a drug deal gone bad. If marijuana was legal then we could also quit getting our cops killed over pot. Everyone knows that drugs are not healthy and that we incur a cost as a society because of their existence. However, the war on drugs cost our society much more money and lives than the drugs themselves ever did. Legalizing marijuana would cut the money supply to the drug cartels, save the taxpayer billions of dollars, ease the pressure on our over crowded prison system, and create an economic boost in the form of adding one more cash crop to the farm industry in our country. Hemp(cousin of marijuana, not a drug) makes good paper, clothes, rope, and bio fuel. But there is a deeper underlying principle that you are neglecting. Since when does the U.S. Constitution allow the Federal Government to dictate what I put in my own body or what I plant in my garden. Fast food kills far more people every year, than marijuana has throughout its 5000 year history. Should we outlaw fastfood? And to say that marijuana is physically addictive is another ignorant rant with no basis in reality. But even if it was, the government still has no right to rape my civil liberties.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1647;"marijuana legalization";"Scientifically proven to kill brain cells? Do your research before making such nonsense claims. The "proof" you speak of comes from a myth perpetuated by the Nixon administration. In order to gain public approval of his policies he referred to a study done on monkeys. At the end of the study the monkeys heads were cut open and the ones exposed to marijuana smoke had lost some brain cells. Years later when the details of the study was finally released, it was revealed that these monkeys had gas masks strapped to their face and were forced to breath columbian grade smoke with no oxygen supplements! They were losing brain cells because of asphyxiation! The only thing that has been "proven" is that the drug war kills far more people than the drugs themselves. And if it was legalized, the price would go down because history shows us that prohibition laws have a major affect on the supply side but a very small change in demand occurs. Decriminalizing pot would leave the demand virtually the same but the supply would increase, thus lowering the cost. Economically, legalization would be a huge positive. Denying that only shows your lack of understanding of basic economics. In other words, your post proves your ignorance.";10;0;2;"Yes, it should be legal"
1647;"marijuana legalization";"Decriminalization would save lives, cut the flow of money to the drug cartels, ease pressure on the prison system, and give our farm industry another cash crop since hemp makes better paper, rope, and bio fuels than traditional sources.

Then you wouldn't have to get it off a drug dealer that also sells cocaine. Because it's Illegal it gets associated with all the other bad drugs, and that doesn't make very much sense.

Assuming you were right in that weed is a gateway drug (which it isn't, by the way) then I would say the reason you may think that is because as it currently stands in order to get weed you would have to connect with a dealer. Dealers often sell other drugs and are often found in shady neighborhoods. I'd imagine if there were any link between weed and other drugs, it would be that you have to associate yourself with the black market which enables access to these other drugs. How do we stop that?

Although almost every study conducted on this very issue shows that drivers who are impaired by marijuana often drive both SAFER and SLOWER because they are aware of their impairment. Compare this to the other most popular drug in America, alcohol. Alcohol is known to cause people to drive more aggressively and with less control. Our answer to that isn't to make alcohol illegal, it's simply to punish the people who use alcohol and later cause accidents. If you're concerned about people driving while high then push laws to prevent people driving under the influence.

Can you even fathom the amount of money the government (and thus the tax payers) would make (save) by legalizing marijuana? Not only could they tax it, but they could release literally hundreds of thousands of non-violent criminals who are currently costing millions if not billions in tax payers' dollars by sitting in prison for possessing a plant that grows naturally on this earth. So you may wonder, why oh why isn't it legal? What does the government have to lose? The truth is that big businesses are fighting like crazy to keep it illegal. To name a few: the pharmaceutical industry, the lumber industry, the cotton industry, the drug lords in other countries, the alcohol industry, the tobacco industry, etc, etc...etc. etc.";10;0;2;yes
466;"marijuana legalization";"Your retort seems to make sweeping arguments without putting forth any evidence to back them up. Please inform me as to the hundreds of thousands of people whose jobs exist for the sole purpose of fighting the drug war. If you can do this, which I do not see happening, you must then show that the legalization of marijuana alone would render their jobs useless. You say they couldn't tax it, well at least, and people wouldn't buy it. I say they could tax it, and they could tax it well, because many people would buy it. Your support for the argument is that people would grow their own and they could grow better quality marijuana. If it were legalized and grown by companies, it would be much easier for these companies to create more potent marijuana. Why is it that you think people would just grow it? What evidence is there of this? The only comparison that I can see is to Tobacco, a plant that can be grown legally throughout the US. A plant that the government taxes like crazy. And a plant for which the majority of smokers still pay $5-6 dollars PER PACK. You say that lumber and cotton wouldn't lose out. Maybe you don't realize why they would lose out. A huge part of the reason for marijuana's initial criminalization was that William Hearst, owner of numerous large newspapers, was threatened by hemp. From Wikipedia: "His paper empire (he owned hundreds of acres of timber forests) was threatened by hemp, which could be regrown yearly. He published many of the stories that Anslinger fabricated, aiding the anti-marijuana movment that eventually led to its prohibition in the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst) Hearst is credited with bringing the word "marijuana" into the English language in order to make the discussion of the plant about race, something which you have agreed to in your arguments. You say that the pharmaceutical industry "COULD" lose out. They would lose money, there is no doubt about it. For every dollar spent on marijuana as a cure for a headache, they would lose that dollar. But it is not the aspirin that would lose out the most, it is medication for the numerous diseases whose symptoms marijuana helps--often more effectively than prescription drugs. Glaucoma, MS, Epilepsy, Pain from surgery, accidents, headaches, etc, Nausea from surgery, chemotherapy, etc. Unless you can provide some support for any of your assertions your rebuttal is completely moot.";10;0;2;yes

So what I am saying is that your friend didnt get screwed up from pot. She got screwed up on other things. People already use and legalizing it isnt going to cause an influx in the amount of users. All that it is going to do is cause the police to not have to spend as much time chasing down people that are using pot. Also they could use the legalization as something similar to a fishing pole. Since it is a gateway drug some people that are using weed will know where to find and since thier judement is impaired will have no problem with telling the police where to find the heavy drug users.

I don't want you to go buy a bag of dope or anything like that, but it is not that bad for you. I am 40+ years old, grew up through the 70's when there was a head shop in every town, and marijuana is a very mild drug when you compare it to a variety of other drugs readily available, including alchohol. Ask yourself a question- when was the last time you heard about someone getting stoned and beating the crap out of their girlfriend and crashing their car into a wall. You haven't, because it hardly ever happens. It does happen with alcohol, every damn weekend. The point is, you should be free to make decisions for yourself. Freedom is the ability to say no or yes to life decisions. Your freind didn't fall apart because she smoked some weed, she smoked some weed because she was falling apart. We don't need the government to tell us what we can and can't do. The crime comes when someone steals or robs to supports a drug habit. But you know what, if the government didn't ban those drugs the laws of supply and demand would lower the price so that the junkie wouldn't have to rob to get the money he needs to support his habit.

The "evidence" that supposedly shows that people would grow their own only states that entrepreneurs would grow their own. That means it would be grown by corporations, not individuals for private use. This is what I've been saying. The only place where it even mentions the people going around the government's taxing is when they say that there is a limit to the amount that the government can tax because if the tax were too high it would be sold on the black market, essentially just making it illegal again. At the very bottom of the article it says this: "Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana." Did you even read this article? Or was it just the first (or second -- http://www.google.com/search?q=marijuana+legalized+grow+own) thing that came up on google? As for tobacco requiring a permit, you should have read a bit further down the page that you cited as a source, because here's what it says: "T15: If I grow tobacco, do I need a license or permit from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)? TTB does not license, or require a permit for, growing tobacco." Once again it looks like you clicked the first thing on google (http://www.google.com/search?q=permit+required+to+grow+tobacco) and used it as a source without really reading it. To call me on using wikipedia and then use sources that not only do not agree with your argument, but DISPROVE your argument, then to go on to use Penn and Teller as a source. I can't even say that's shady, that's absolutely nonsensical. Your other broad assertions which have no references (perhaps for the better) have to do with capitalism. You say that lumber companies could just start growing hemp. This would cost a great deal of money, and it would provide an opening for other companies to take over. Granted, the lumber companies would probably have an advantage, as they already have much of the land and machinery to stay on top if hemp were a viable resources. But why would the company, if it's already on top, want to spend the amount of money required and take the huge risk of being overtaken by a competitor? They wouldn't. You talk about pharmaceutical companies as if they're one huge corporation headed by a single person. Marinol is produced by one small company, so the only argument that you might have is that Solvay Pharmaceutical may or may not want marijuana to be legalized. The problem is that Solvay doesn't mean a thing--they only make 10 different medications, all of which I've never heard of. Whereas Bayer alone makes 89 (that are listed on their page at least). Before you call someone shady make sure that your facts are even remotely correct, and that the sources you cite actually promote your argument--not go against it.";10;0;2;yes

First the Marihuana Tax Act made it so expensive for pharmeceutical firms to use thc-the active ingredient of canibas-by the way an anti-biotic that they stopped making it easier for it to be made illegal The constitution was written on hemp paper as the ropes of all the US ships were made of hemp.

Not that there is any danger of canibas sativa or canibas indica to become extinct in the US as it is an indigenous plant, it used to grow wild, many parks and natural areas of the nation still have species of marihuana growing wild, however they are of the non-inotxicant variety Here in the Golden State of California, our state flower is the "golden poppy", that's right, a cousin of the same flower that gives us opium, morphine, heroin et al Hashish oil has been prescribed in India as a cold remedy for milenia, just like the Nubians and Egyptians brewed and consumed beer, so did they grow and consume canibas The illegalization of herb like with the stupid Prohibition before it is a residue of the extreme religious and puritanical right, the same group that would want to make creationism taught in school and make abortion illegal re-creating the black market meet a dr in the alley, find a coathangar times of the past.

3599;"marijuana legalization";"When it comes to the legalization of marijuana, there are virtually no cons to this argument. The legalization of marijuana would: 1. Save incredible amounts of money in the legal system. Not having to prosecute hundreds of thousands (720,000 people were arrested for marijuana in 2001-see #3 below) of people and jail tens of thousands would reduce pressure on our already overstretched law enforcement and legal systems as well as reduce prison overcrowding, which is becoming a huge issue. 2. Legalizing marijuana would reduce crime. Besides eliminating the crime of being a smoker, legalizing marijuana would reduce all sorts of other crime such as violent crimes (drug dealers would no longer shoot each other for deals gone bad, because people could legally get it and thus there would be no profit from it), and it would reduce the amount of money that gangs and the like could make to fund their activities. 3. Legalizing marijuana would provide a higher level of control over the product. Buyers of marijuana would no longer have to worry about their weed being laced with harmful drugs or produced in situations using pesticides that are illegal in the US. Governments could tax the use of marijuana that is sold to consumers, providing an instant revenue stream. 4. Legalizing marijuana would reduce human suffering. Marijuana is one of the only known effective treatments for a host of conditions ranging from multiple sclerosis to glaucoma and HIV-related problems such as wasting away due to lack of appetite. Marijuana also reduces the pain and loss of appetite associated with chemotherapy. 5. Legalizing marijuana would help American farmers. Being able to grow a mixed crop of smokable and industrial hemp would help small family farms. Many small family farms currently do grow marijuana as a way to help them compete with huge agribusinesses as there are few other alternatives available to remain financially solvent. 6. Legalizing marijuana would reduce its use by children. Studies have shown that marijuana is usually easier to get for high school students than alcohol due to the fact that it is unregulated. Though marijuana should be legalized, it should not be used by children at any point unless prescribed by a doctor (and even then only eaten and not smoked). 7. Legalizing marijuana would not increase its use. Studies of marijuana use in the Netherlands have shown that since its decriminalization there has been no increase in its use. Removing the taboo of its use would reduce its use among children, as there would be less of a dangerous mystique about it. Though there may be an increase in use just after legalization, over time the overall numbers would decrease significantly. Cons to marijuana legalization: 1. Large pharmaceutical companies may lose some profits if marijuana is legalized. Keeping marijuana illegal is in the interests of many large pharmaceutical companies because people would be less reliant on them if they could grow their own inexpensive medicine. 2. Alcohol and tobacco companies would lose profits as well. Deaths related to alcohol total about 75,000 per year and tobacco use results in about 440,000 premature deaths per year. In contrast, the number of known marijuana overdose deaths throughout history is about zero. Cannabis provides both the smoking pleasure and relaxation benefits of both tobacco and alcohol with fewer risks to responsible adults. All in all, marijuana legalization is truly a win-win-win situation. I hope this helps you on your journey! IF your going to vote for against legalization please at least state why.

Also, the effects of marijuana IN GENERAL occasions, last for much shorter time periods than that of alcohol. There are many deaths from drunk driving each year and yet there are no record to any deaths from overdosing on cannabis. The effects of alcohol are also much worse than that of cannabis, but I do agree that people who toke should not be allowed to drive. I do disagree with what you said about governments telling us which drugs to take and which not to. The only reason marijuana is illegal to this day is that, back when the law was passed that made cannabis illegal people were not well informed on what this 'dangerous' drug could do to us.

They lose money, we gain medicine for diseases such as multiple schlorosis, less people are put in jail which decreases the amount of money invested in jails.

Of course, MJ causes much less impairment than alcohol, yet alcohol is legal. 4) It's much, much safer than tobacco, which is legal. It's actually harder to OD on MJ than alcohol, and alcohol is legal. As for medicine, it has a legitimate role in treating some serious illnesses.

While many have reported an increase in appetite after smoking marijuana...people in developing countries use marijuana to alleviate hunger. For example, workers in the sugar cane fields of Jamaica have traditionally smoked marijuana, to increase their ability to work longer without food. Although it is currently the most widely used illegal drug in the United States, its legal status is somewhat confusing and contradictory. Technically, it is illegal for anyone to possess any amount of marijuana for any purpose, with the sole exception of approved scientific research. (It is listed as a Schedule 1 controlled substance.) However, in eleven states, consumers are legally allowed to possess small amounts of marijuana, prescribed solely for medicinal purposes. Some localities have even passed laws allowing for the possession of small amounts of marijuana for private use in a person's own home. The catch is that...federal laws always trump any state or local laws, and in fact...the Supreme Court has consistently ruled in favor of the federal government, in cases relating to the use of medical marijuana. We can talk about the pluses and minuses of the use of marijuana...we can for any drug...but, people are going to smoke it anyway.

However, as mentioned, it's better than tobacco. Also, you can get high off hash brownies and other non-smoked forms of MJ. 4) Perhaps. Now compare it with the effect of alcohol, which is entirely legal. 5) I think you man dependency. In any case, it's not a particularly addictive drug. Much less so than alcohol, much less tobacco. 6) Does it? I forget. Seriously, sure it does and that's bad.

Note that both tobacco and alcohol are illegal for children. 8) This is an argument for legalization, so that the MJ isn't mixed in with weird stuff. 9) That's actually backwards. Unlike some drugs, you need less MJ to get high, over time. 10) See above regarding legalization. 11) Yes, you should not get pregnant while taking recreational drugs.

You know what really reduces a person's ability to drive? Being sent to jail for a few years. Drinking and driving is dangerous. Does that mean we should make alcohol illegal?

Keeping marijuana illegal indirectly reduces of the supply of it, but does not reduce the demand.

Furthermore, crime rates would not go up due to drug legalization. You provide no evidence that people will use more drugs due to legalization. People do not use pot because it is illegal but because they do not want to use it in the first place due to other reasons. Moreover, the price of pot will actually decrease further decreasing the likelihood of these robberies, which you mention. It's legalization spurs corporations to enter in the pot market, a capitalistic free market system will force the price down. On the other hand, in the current system, drug dealers basically have a hold on many customers( essentially a local monopoly) where he or she can manipulate the price for personal profit.

Now I'm not saying that all illicit drugs should be legal just because people still use them anyway. But the fact is that marijuana is really not as bad as the hype around it. If it were legalized than it would also be controlled in terms of level of THC and the like - ie it would be even safer. I think a pretty solid argument could be put forward that alcohol is worse for you than marijuana. For example: you can overdose on alcohol to the point of death. You can not overdose on marijuana. While there are definitely ill effects that result from marijuana, I can't find any reliable source that suggests it is more (or even equal to, for that matter) the ill effects of alcohol or tobacco (perhaps someone on the otherside could point me in the right direction. Also if it became legal than the government could tax the sh*t out of it, like they have for tobacco (at least in Aus). Seems like a smart move. In response to an argument on the other side- I don't think you would really have to measure the amount of THC (or "highness" or what have you) You could probably just put a blanket ban like 'you can not operate machinery with mj in your system' They already have easy little saliva tests that they do along with RBTs. check out this table: http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/2009/visualising-the-guardian-datablog/ that shows alcohol as being the cause of many more deaths than cannabis. as does this one: http://www.saferchoice.org/content/view/24/53/ this one is a good source for many studies on alcohol/marijuana: http://mphdegree.org/2010/marijuana-vs-alcohol-25-enlightening-studies-and-infographics/";10;0;2;For

Mobsters and the Mafia were smuggling in alcoholic beverages in and out of the country, and because it was illegal, there was a brutal war between the gangs and the police.

With this drug war slowly but surely creeping upwards to the States, we are just digging our own graves. Once the fervor has reached the Americans, there may be an all-out revolution for drug rights. Let's be proactive, and just legalize these drugs, which by the way are far less harmful than alcohol anyways.

With proper taxing on drugs, economists estimate we can make a revenue of over 5 billion dollars every year. Point 3: There are tens of millions of people in prison at any given time. I'd estimate about half of them are in there because they were involved in some drug-trade related crime. Had these drugs been legal, they would not be there, and our cops can focus on catching violent criminals rather than mere drug-traders.";10;0;2;Yes
2;"marijuana legalization";"2.a. First of all, you are mistakenly assuming that drug cartels and grow operations have no overhead. They have to pay for protection, they have legal fees, and there is the risk of being shut down and arrested, and this risk is factored into selling prices. Additionally, they cannot simply "pay their employees jack" otherwise there would be no incentive against these employees turning in their employers. Organized crime relies heavily on loyalty. That is how cartels and gangs survive. Without the promise of payment and other perks, no one would be loyalty to those above them. Secondly, I think you are vastly underestimating the massive wealth and power of corporations. If pot were legalized, the agricultural and pharmaceutical mega-corporations would undoubtedly swoop in and take control of the production. If there is one thing that these entities are able to do well, it is make massive profits while spending as little on overhead. Legit operations are the ones that pay employees jack. They are doing nothing illegal. Unethical, sure. But disgruntled employees can do nothing about it. Thirdly, even if the corporations managed to purchase from illegal cartels, and sell the illegal product in-country, they would still fall under the the purview of the FDA. While this organization is by no means perfect, it does manage to force corporations to label their products accordingly. Anyone who does not comply faces lawsuits and other legal action. Sure the pot may be laced with things, but it would not be a surprise. Nothing illegal (i.e. meth, or other cheap drugs that are thrown into pot to make it seem better) could be legally added, and if the corporations wanted to use the "healthier than alcohol" angle, they couldn't put much in it. Finally, just look at the Netherlands. They have it legalized, and it is controlled, and cheaper than in the USA.";10;0;2;Yes

Reasonable would be to say its highly probable, but highly illogical otherwise. b) but there is no flaw in the alcohol is worse argument. And you know what they say, if its not wrong, then its right. But if we don't turn right, then we turn left. But if we have this other bad thing, that's three lefts, which is a right.";10;0;2;Yes
4899;"marijuana legalization";"2) b) Prostitution, in my opinion, is completely different. Sure, if you want to increase profits, you'd deal with human traffickers to gain individuals who have no say in the matter for a lower price. The government can't offer up "cheaper" women for you. With MJ, I feel that scientists/researchers in the US would be able to, and already do, create much higher quality products for cheaper than simple farmers. 4) a) MJ is already directed towards kids. Just like every other drug out there. b) It's ignorant to assume Marijuana is "bad" just like Alcohol is "bad." Moderation.";10;0;2;Yes

There are worse things in the world, and people need to tend to their own lifestyles and households and allow others to make the choice for themselves. As with all "addictions" the results vary for everyone. The bottom line, this is why America is a free country and the citizens make their own choice. At any rate, right or wrong marijuana is becoming legal throughout the States as policy is reviewed. Medicinal properties have been tested and approved. The US Government sends through the US Mail medical marijuana monthly. Returning Vets with legitimate physical and mental problems are allowed to grow it for private use. So, people need to do their research before passing judgement on what is right or wrong. If it is not right for you, then don't do it. For many that are in constant pain daily it is right.

632;"marijuana legalization";"Yes, I don't really see a strong reason why it should remain illegal. Many, many people do it and it's not going away. Even many people in law enforcement, who deal with the scum of the earth, think it should be legalized or at least decriminalized. A lot of people have this big fear that if it's legalized that suddenly teenagers will be able to get it and all sorts of bad things will start happening. These people don't seem to realize that teenagers already have it. Clinton did it, though he had to lie and say he didn't inhale, which is the most pathetic excuse ever. Al Gore was known to be constantly stoned throughout college. Obama admitted to doing it and Bush Jr. did coke so you know he's done it as well. I've known people who have stoned throughout college and gone on to do great things. Bill Gates did LSD, so you know he's done it. You can easily find pictures of Mark Zuckerberg online stoned. Arnold did it. These people should not be considered criminals for their use of it. Pretty much everyone has done it and we all move on with our lives and still do great things. I think it would be more difficult to come up with a list of influential people who haven't done it.";10;0;2;Yes

2;"marijuana legalization";"Weak argument man. Alcohol affects intelligence as well. I understand if you personally hate pot or pot culture (the culture certainly doesn't sell the product well). But would you really say that the government is justified in telling citizens what they can and cannot consume, **especially** considering pot is less dangerous than other illegal drugs, and some say, alcohol? For the government, I can only see benefits to legalization. 1. Increased tax revenue (from producers, new corporations, etc.) 2. Less money to be spent on drug enforcement (cannabis could be ATF's responsibility) 3. Legalization would make the industry subject to tax law, making it clear where revenue was going (no more funding terror organizations, organized crime or drug cartels)";10;0;2;Yes

If marijuana is illegal for the fact that it is addictive than we really should make alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, meds, and even food illegal. There are many deaths caused by alcohol and cigarettes. There is NO report of a death caused by marijuana. If you want to be a brainless droid that the government wants you to be than go ahead but don't take my freedom to live my life pain-free. The pharmaceutical companies want you to think mj is dangerous bcoz they don't want to go bankrupt which is exactly what would happen since mj treats many ailments. Instead of believing everything the government wants you to believe why don't you read the research. Also GOD made marijuana and in GOD we trust right? Man made alcohol and cigarettes.

4227;"marijuana legalization";"Marijuana should be legalized for many reasons. 1.) Legalizing marijuana would free up our jails, courts, and give the police the ability to focus on real crime. 2.) Marijuana is not proven to cause serious harm inits historic 3,000 years of use, while cigarettes and alcohol are known to be harmful as well as potentially harmful to others around the user. 3.) Marijuana is the largest cash crop in many states, with a failing economy, why not take advantage of this money maker? 4.) Keeping marijuana illegal keeps the money flowing into criminal hands ( remember prohibition?) 5.) Marijuana has many medicinal properties that can prolong dying peoples ( cancer and Aids victims) lives, as well as making them more comfortable. Meanwhile criminals are robbing pharmacies to get their hands on Oxycontin ( perfectly legal if prescribed and a very addictive/ abused drug)... The idea that the country will go marijuana crazy if it legalized is absurd. This country is already a country of pot smokers. Our Constitution is written on hemp, and out Forefathers grew it.Beleving that something should be made illegal because our government says it should is a scary way to think.

3974;"marijuana legalization";"People that want marijuana to be legal = PATRIOTS.";10;0;2;Yes
1572;"marijuana legalization";"This is actually a ridiculous argument, of course it should be legal. It is far less a problem than alcohol, and in fact, far, far less toxic. It even has anti-cancer properties. The people that think otherwise are just classic victims of government propaganda. What most people don't know is that marijuana was not made illegal to protect the public, but to protect the paper mills, and the cotton industry from competition. Hemp would have quickly replaced wood and cotton. Both industries at that time had stockholders with a lot of clout, some of them even secretly funded, and lobbied for hemp/marijuana to be made illegal. These days marijuana competes with those same industries, but also the pharmaceutical industry. Big Pharma alone stands to loses literally billions of dollars of revenue from competing marijuana. In fact, there is very few ailments that marijuana can not have a positive impact on. It is the least toxic pain reliever on earth, and when used properly a great anti-depressant, and anti-anxiety alternative. Marijuana's uses are to many to even begin to list, but really this is all besides the point. Are we not adults? Are we not capable of deciding what we can put in our very bodies??? Do you want someone (big government ) telling you what to do? Telling you when to eat, what to eat, where to live, what to do??? Since when did government gain so much authority over our lives? What gives them such great insight as to be able to determine whats good for me? Too many people still don't realize just how corrupt our government is. Marijuana is not illegal because it's dangerous for you and me, but because it's dangerous to the elites. For us, we can treat many illnesses with nothing more than a plant that can be grown virtually anywhere, or we can use it in a recreational manor to tune into wavelengths that aren't normally there. Marijuana helps people to relax, and enjoy the moment, and it never makes people violent or seriously ill as alcohol does. It's only a stigma because the government made it one to protect the corporations that really run this country. Think I'm wrong? Do some serious research, and you will learn otherwise... Marijuana is a blessing from God to be treated, and used with our respect.";10;0;2;Yes

Using your logic we would have to ban milk because 99.9% of all heroin addicts began drinking milk, ditto for murderers, thiefs, rapists etc etc Gangs main income from drugs is crack-cocaine because it is far more profitable utilizing far less space Canibas is actually an anti-biotic and until 1937 when the Marijuana Tax Act was passed was in over 75% of over the counter cough syrups in the US You best go back and learn about what your are argueing about because your ignorance is staggering";10;0;2;agree
