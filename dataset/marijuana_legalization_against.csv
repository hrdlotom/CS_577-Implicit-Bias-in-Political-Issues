1098,"marijuana legalization","Now...I must admit, i have definitely tried my share. I don't anymore, but I did plenty, so I'm a bit of a hypocrite.
The reason I say it shouldn't be legalized is because I have seen it be a "gateway drug," as much as I hate that term.
Once you're in the culture of hanging out doing drugs, other things that you would have never considered doing before don't seem as bad anymore and get moved out of that 'i would never do that' category.
so, i think, the less weed out there for kids, the better.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
507,"marijuana legalization","is this seriously an argument??
marijuana messes with your head and causes you to (scientifically proven) lose brain cells. i guess if you think you're smart enough to not need those braincells, then, puff away.
the chance of mj being legalized is less than slim to none... the government will NOT make enough money off of it being done. there's no real profit in it for them, because with all their packaging costs and so forth they could not sell it for as little as your local dealer...
my advice to all the druggies out there is to just enjoy it in it's illegal state... because if they do decide to legalize it, it's gonna jump in price.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
1580,"marijuana legalization","The argument is not if cigarettes should be illegal, but if marijuana should be. Marijuana has a more potent dose or carcinogens to users, which rules out the theory of it being less harmful.
As for cigarettes, the issue of it becoming legal may not be possible. It is one of those drugs that is too engrained in our culture to be removed; often, when a drug is legal and heavily used, it will remain indefinitely. However, marijuana use is not nearly so prevalent, yet. If it is legalized, there may be no way to reverse it; future attempts to go back on possible damage caused will lead to even more resistance and illegal use.
It is better off left illegal. With the ills caused by cigarettes echoed so closely, we have a chance to not cause that in future years with a newer drug. No reason to blow the chance permanently.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
10,"marijuana legalization","Not that I disagree with your argument, I just disagree with your logic. Your argument doesn't address the topic. Should marijuana be illegal has nothing to do with cigarettes. It has to do with itself.
Yes I agree, cigarettes are terrible, one of the worst inventions of capitalism. It is the original cause for slavery in the US. The english didn't find gold in the new land, they found tobacco. There was such a high demand for it back in England that they needed a large "workforce" to harvest, cut, and dry all of it, ie slaves. It holds a tight grip on it's victims who may know that, but don't realize it, until it's too late. Often they're on their death bed, dying from emphesima at the age of 55, screaming that they don't want to go, but their lungs give up on them (my wife's grandmother who died at 55).
But it is no reason why marijuana should be legal. Marijuana is also less dangerous than alcohol. Which is responsible for 50% of fatal car accidents, 50% of homicides (are committed under the unfluence), and don't forget domestic violence. Drunk guys sure do love beating their wives and kids. Marijuana calms you down (unless you get paranoid from it), and alcohol pisses you off. Drunk guys always want to fight, notice? I've seen a lot of drunk fights, and I've seen a lot of high people fall down stairs, and just laugh it off.
But doesn't mean marijuana should be legal. I want to hear a good argument. I'm serious, I mean I want to hear a good reason. I'm interested.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
10,"marijuana legalization","Agreed, point is, "it's not as bad as cigarettes" or "it's not as bad as alcohol" isn't a reason to make it legal. There are lots of worse things out there. I want to hear a substantial argument. One that can stand on its own.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
10,"marijuana legalization","Finally a good argument. I like your argument, and so far it has educated me. Do you have sources for that information you can share with us?",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
279,"marijuana legalization","Legalizing a drug is like saying, HEY! Go kill yourself, Its proven that drugs have negative affects on the human body.

1684,"marijuana legalization","Marijuana shouldn't necessarily be compared to cigarettes as it always is. One of the most common arguments I hear toward keeping marijuana illegal is "Marijuana smoke contains (insert random large number here) toxins." But one fact that is never addressed is:
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SMOKE IT.
Smoking isn't the only way to get THC into your system. You could simply eat it, and get no toxins from smoke by going that route.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
454,"marijuana legalization","Yeah, that's all we need...a stoned person getting behind the wheel and crashing into a minivan full of kids...and then not being reprimanded for the drugs in his system.

Hey, and get this :ON THE INTERSTATE
WOW!",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
1077,"marijuana legalization","No, they couldn't still drive. People would be forbidden to drive while under the influence of marijuana, just like alcohol. Why doesn't that make sense?
It could be legal only for use in one's home.

403,"marijuana legalization","And when Marijuanna is proven to be a hazzard to your health (and millions of others) are you willing to suck itup and say, "Darn - I guess I deserved that." Or will you back unending law suits against the makers of marjuanna joints? It's unhealthy. Just because you want something - it doesn't mean you should get it.

454,"marijuana legalization","How would you possibly plan on using it "responsibly" and calling yourself a professional. It is a proven fact that it has a lifelong effect on your brain cells. See if you can get hired after using this deadly substance.
Also, go ahead and throw vehicular homicide on to your resume, you'll get very far i'm sure.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
1390,"marijuana legalization","You must be honestly out of your mind if you think that marijuana should be legalized. There are teenagers all over the world who smoke pot already, and you want to encourage more of them to try it? Don't give me your "I smoke weed" bullsh*t. It's bad for you. I don't honestly give a rat's ass about how cool you are or how wonderful it makes you feel.
Marijuana kills. As stated before, it causes you to lose brain cells, and puts you in a state of euphoria. Don't tell me you can make responsible decisions when you're high, much less drive a car. There are hundreds of car accidents every day across the country that are only classified as such - "accidents" - when many of them are caused by substances that slow your reflexes and your distort your mind like marijuana. So don't post some asinine statistic about how marijuana kills only a few people a year.
Besides the problem of SMOKING marijuana, there's the problem of GETTING it. Ever hear of the drug trade? Columbia? South America? Drug lords are killing hundreds of people each day, waging wars for turf and business. You think that's cool? Do you honestly believe that it's right for people to die for your drugs? Can you smoke with a clear conscience knowing people have died to grow that pinch of grass you put in your pipe? No, it's not cool. It's stupid. It's retarded. And it should be illegal.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
1390,"marijuana legalization","Yeah, how many people, especially teenagers, actually THINK before they do something? How many people, while in a drunken state, actually stop to consider whether or not they SHOULD or SHOULD NOT drive? What makes you think that people will be responsible?
And "it is otherwise harmless" - it causes damage to BRAIN CELLS, the one's that DON'T grow back, and no operation ever will bring them back. It may also cause psychological disorders, especially depression, and perhaps even schizophrenia. Also, it significantly lowers the immune system, so you might just as well go have unprotected sex in Africa.
How many people die per year from marijuana related "accidents"? How many people are killed in drug wars and in the ghettos? More than you will ever know. How do I know this? For seven years of my life I lived in the slums. I hung around drug dealers. One of my closest friends was killed in a drug related incident. Have you ever been into the slums? Have you ever seen, or felt poverty? What gives you the right to make such claims?",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
1258,"marijuana legalization","It's the "proven facts" that are debatable.
The notion that cannabis, tobacco and alcohol ALL have permanent effects on one's brain cells is not beyond all doubts. There are studies that have proven those concepts. There are also studies, just as reputable, which have proven that it is not necessarily so.",10,1,"No, it should not be legal"
878,"marijuana legalization","It sorta depends upon what type of hemp they use... they now have industrial hemp that has no narcotics in it so when you smoke it you won't get high and hemp is definately a more effect plant then using pulp for paper and it can be used for so many things...

I know plenty of people that say "If pot was legal, I'd smoke everyday". So let's legalize everything and really screw up the world. and taxes!!

Most of you are claiming that Marijuana is safer than Cigarrettes and Alcohol and has Medical Benefits such as it fights Cancer and is Thermopedic and Such.
Ask yourself this, Are You Using marijuana for Medical reasons OR are you just making an excuse to get High?
Thats what i thought
Marijuana is already legal to anyone who is Prescribed it for Legitimate reasons. But obviously none of you are prescribed it because you just want to get high. Thats very Hypocritical of you guys.
Listen, I drink and smoke. Why? Because it's bad for me and i enjoy the feeling of being drunk (poisoned) and smoking (light-headed). I dont make excuses or lie about why I do these 2 things, Unlike you Potheads that are in denial..
Example: Percocets and Vicoden are drugs prescribed for patients in Pain. But most patients abuse these drugs to simply get High.

894,"marijuana legalization","Marijuana kills people. Thats all that needs to be said really. There are no benefits to using it. There is just no need for Marijuana in society. It makes drug lords rich and users poor. Its addictive nature means that after a couple, or even a single use, your body begins to produce less 'happy hormones', and you need to smoke it just to feel normal.

1011,"marijuana legalization","Although its true that Marijuana is no worse than alcohol, it should not be legalized for one reason.
In the early 1900's, cotton companies that made clothes, such as jeans were losing money to companies that produced jeans out of the marijuana plant. The marijuana plant could produce clothes that were twice as durable and lasted twice as long, and still feel the same or better than cotton. Basically, marijuana was a better clothing product. The cotton companies were sick of losing money to the marijuana companies. There were some big shot cotton company owners that had friends in high places, such as the supreme court. So you can probably guess the rest. The supreme court basically did a favor for the cotton companies by making the marijuana plant illegal. Marijuana is no worse, or maybe even better then some drugs that are today legally used.

That is IN NO WAY a valid argument for making marijuana legal. All it is, is an argument for making cigarettes illegal. That is all it is.
If you wanted to use the cigarettes to promote legalization of marijuana - and withstanding that the two can be compared because they have the same type of downsides - you would have to argument that cigarettes are not harmful.

I think that legalising cannabis would intensify the so-called "thrill factor" for class B and A drugs, therefore there would be more illegal sales of that sort.

422,"marijuana legalization","In principle, I do not believe the government - ANY government - ought to have the right to tell us what substances we may, or may not, partake of. It's a freedom thing.
Having said this, I DO have an issue with marijuana and driving. As in, the time for marijuana to 'become flushed' from one's system is much longer than that of alcohol - some people take 2 days to metabolize it. And, some of the active ingredients are deposited into our fatty tissues - and a sudden influx of adrenalin CAN cause them to enter the bloodstream and cause someone to be 'high' weeks after their last toke.
This makes some difficulties for me - only in relation to driving and professional activities.
So, what I would suggest is that people who choose to drive (or have jobs requiring clear thinking) 'ought to' also choose to voluntarily abstain from marijuana. Therefore, I would like to rephrase the position above to describe mine:
The privilage of driving should not be granted to people who use marijuana.",10,1,"Against Legalization"
422,"marijuana legalization","OK, I need to clarify.
There are things that I think the government 'ought to' have control over, and things that the government 'ought not' have control over.
The government is in charge of infrastructures. As such, they have jurisdiction over roads - and it is their right to restrict the right for individuals to drive on these roads. That is why they issue driving licences: this is the means through which they exercise this control. They can set any rules they want to here. Frankly, were I in the priviliged position to make these rules, I would restrict driving only to those people not under the influence of intoxicants of any kind: as in, zero level in the blood - be it prescription medication, alcohol, marijuana, or whatever other intoxicant.
That is, the government does - and must - have the right to control who does or does not get the privilage of driving. If you are intoxicated, even a little, you 'ought not' to be allowed to drive (in my never-humble opinion).
The government, however, does not have the right to 'protect us from ourselves'. Or, at least, it 'ought not' have that right. That is intrusive and an unreasonable limit on our freedoms to act as we choose.
Thus, what we do in our privacy is not any of the government's business - or, at least, it 'ought not to be'. As such, it is inappropriate for the government to ban drugs it deems dangerous or inappropriate. Preventing me from making a choice - while I am in the privacy of my own home and not interacting with anyone else - is an unreasonable limitation on my rights.
As such, it is my opinion that the government is overstepping its authority when it bans certain drugs - medical or not.",10,1,"Against Legalization"
422,"marijuana legalization","Ah, but this is not a debate about drinking and driving - rather, it is about toking and driving. (Well, I hope I have re-defined this to be my position.)
I am convinced it should not be legal to drive with ANY alcohol in one's bloodstream. Many European countries have gone that way - and it really does make sense to me. Personally, I have NEVER driven with even the slightest amount of alcohol in my bloodstream, because I do understand the effects this has on the nervous system. But, that, I thought, would be a different debate...",10,1,"Against Legalization"
422,"marijuana legalization","I suppose what I am trying to say - but am not doing a good job of expressing - is that I do not think ANY drug OUGHT TO be illegal.
Marijuana, Acid, Meth - whatever. Recreational, medical, snake oil - they ought to have no right to limit your choices. They may inform you of the consequences, but they ought not have the right to ban substances on the grounds that THEY think them bad, harmful or whatever.
The government OUGHT NOT have the right to prevent you from harming yourself.
IF - while under influence - you break the law (as in, a proper law, they DO have a right to pass) - either a traffic law, or you commit violence or property crime - THEN and ONLY then does the government have jurisdiction, so to speak.
I see this as a 'rights' issue - the drug in question is irrelevant. Of course, under these conditions, there is no room to ban the really bad stuff, either. But, that is a lesser cost (in my never-humble-opinion) than to give up this right and allow any government to meddle with our lives at THIS level.

3958,"marijuana legalization","I have multiple reasons to believe that legalizing marijuana would be an idiotic idea....Lets take a look at some of these reasons
1. Multiple studies show that marijuana can damage your health and cause psychological conflicts.
2. Causes problems in families. I.E. The kid wants to get high and 'forget his problems,' and refuses to take time with his family members.
3. Every day in the news you hear about a man causing an accident because he was under the influence of alcahol. If marijuana was legalized it would increase the rate of crashes, since marijuana causes psychological effects in your brain and dont allow you to operate as you would normally do. Imagine how many mothers would feel about their children being run over by a stoned man, since marijuana slows down your ability to react, the kid would be destroyed by the time the driver stopped.
4. 'Its used in medicine.' Please, marijuana has been found to have over 100 dangerous substances in it, is this what you wanna get 'cured with?' I dont think so.",10,1,No

You say that keeping MJ illegal would not, in any way, lower the number of people driving while high.

2808,"marijuana legalization","Here we go again, TH. : )
Okay, lets quit comparing Marijuana to tobacco. Tobacco's legal and marijuana isn't and that's that. Tobacco doesn't mess with the brain, make one high and insensitive or slow to react.
Marijuana contains a psychoactive chemical called tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC significantly diminishes psychomotor skills and attention span. It reduces a person’s ability to perform tracking tasks - for example, like using a steering wheel and watching for pedestrians while driving. You claim that it's less dangerous - I beg to differ.
One can tell when a marijuana user is high (or even a frequent marijuana user). The eyes are bloodshot, the person disoriented and prone to anger, attention span is nil and a user often appears to be stupid during a time when high. It affects the heart and rate of pace. Let's not forget that the high is addictive and leads on to a need for more. It's psychologically addictive and the withdrawal is painful.
Also, marijuana does not contain a consistent amount of THC. Some marijuana has extremely high amounts and soem has low amounts. There is no way to tell until it is actually smoked and consequences reaped later.
I notice that soem of you have mentioned that regulating marijuana would be the thing to do. So, you want to, firstly, practically encourage the dealing of a harmful substance, make it appear to kids to be less harmful than it actually is ( I can see it now "You take it, so why can't I???"), and then complicate the legality of it by regulations? Don't people complain about gun laws because somebody came up witht he brilliant idea of regulations? This would be the same except much worse. If cannibas, a dangerous substance, were to be regulated, it would complicate issues and tie up officials, funding and money that could be better used elsewhere. It would complicate teh law and judicial decisions.
It is much safer to ensure that marijuana maintains a negative publicity and illegal for everybody. While research does not show that marijuana use would increase if legal, I bet that it would skyrocket. People who abstain from sing it simply because they follow the law would not be given free reign to utilize and addictive and dangerou substance.
The legalization of cannibas is not the awnser. If anything, it would increase the amount of addictions and then the amount of druggies who must move onto a more powerful drug rather than crasking down and trying to eliminate its use and black market dealings from the streets.",10,1,No

What bill?",10,1,"No, it shouldn't be legal"
3713,"marijuana legalization","Dr Porpoises, that I like to see, do they have RN Dolfins?",10,1,"No, it shouldn't be legal"
4030,"marijuana legalization","So I'm assuming this "bill" is referring to one that would be created if marijuana was legalized. I'm assuming this because there is no bill for the legalization of marijuana. Alright, so assuming that, it would consider anyone with more than 3-4 grams a drug dealer? If marijuana is legalized so what if someone's a drug dealer? It's legal, people won't need drug dealers, it could be sold in stores so that makes no sense. Secondly, where does coccaine come into this? Coccaine is a very serious drug, and should never even be considered for leaglization. Third medical centers already do use marijuana for medical purposes. So, so much for that point.
In my opinion it shouldn't be legalized. People are doing it regardless. If you were smart and really wanted to you can use it and not get caught, many people already do. So I don't see the point in legalizing marijuana because it would make it more acceptable in society, this is an issue for children and teens because the "scare factor" from it being illegal would be gone, and that could make them more inclined to use it. It could even make people more likely to smoke and drive, even if there were a law against it, it's not like you can put a measure on how high you are like you can how drunk you are. Again having it not be illegal would make people less afraid to get caught driving while high. Now i'm not saying it's fine to break the law, but people will always break the law there's no changing that. Honestly there's no need for it to be legalized and it could easily go ugly. The already extremely high obesity rate in America could easily sky rocket. People would begin to neglect their responsibilities, If you've ever heard Afro man's song "Because I Got High" :) I know people already are using drugs and alcohol and neglecting their responsibilities and such, and people who don't use them neglect their's as well but just because there's already a problem doesn't mean we should add to it.

Its a problem with booze,but you can do roadside tests on that. With pot, as far as I know you’d have to do a blood or urine test to see if its in their system (cannot be done instantly on roadside) and it only indicates if its there or not, not the amount.
So either cops can pull and arrest people on suspicion and force them to wait for the tests to be confirmed. or they can and there will be more accidents.
How do you solve this problem? or is there a way to do roadside tests?",10,1,"No, it should not be legalized for personal use"
3130,"marijuana legalization","Legalized? No. Decriminalized? Perhaps.
The laws are screwed up, and something certainly needs to be done, but jumping to the other extreme seems like just as bad an idea as keeping things the way they are. There are always other options.
I'd elaborate, but I'm tired, and I have an essay due in the morning.",10,1,No

4296,"marijuana legalization","Couldn't you use similar argumentation to justify legalizing any narcotic or otherwise dangerous substance? I'm not saying Marijuana is dangerous beyond the slight cancer risks, but you could hardly argue it is beneficial. I'm for decriminalizing mj--people shouldn't go to jail for posession--it should be treated similar to speeding tickets.",10,1,No
3130,"marijuana legalization","Okay, I'm going to lay out a quick response.
Ask yourself, what happens when an illegal drug becomes legal? Answer: it goes corporate.
If MJ is legalized then it will become a new industry overnight, one that will undoubtedly be just as charming and scrupulous as the tobacco and alcohol industries. This will have several effects.
1) MJ sees a massive expansion. It's be grown more, consumed more, and costs less. Pot cafes and growers crop up everywhere. The government sets up a tax and regulations, then they wait and see.
2) Instead of driving the criminals out of the market, legalization sends the criminals into business. Because the morally bankrupt cartels can produce pot cheaper than American farmers, the new industry will start buying at least a good portion of its product from them. The government will try to regulate it, but like prostitution in the Netherlands, the industry will expand so fast that the fed just won't be ready for it. Because the demand for pot has jumped so much, its possible that the cartels end up making MORE money than before, even if they get a smaller percentage of the business.
Like in Amsterdam, pot cafes in middle class areas end up drawing lots petty criminals, and drive up the crime rates.
3) The industry starts cutting corners. Like cigarettes, they cutting the joints with nasty, nasty, stuff that hurts you. But people still smoke them because, as we saw in Amsterdam, even with the health risks, people still prefer to smoking to swallowing.
4) The MJ industry markets pot to kids. This drives down grades, and drives up DUIs. Regular pot use can permanently damage developing brains, so you can bet that's happening now.
5) The money made from legalizing pot pot is largely sapped away by the costs of regulation, and medical costs.
6) People get the munchies for human flesh. Oh, wait, that's Reefer Madness. But everything else still stands.",10,1,No
4897,"marijuana legalization","Evidence? How?",10,1,No
3130,"marijuana legalization","2)
a) Illegal pot will still be able to undersell competitors because if you grow it illegally (and most likely out off the country) you don't have to pay your workers jack, you don't have to make sure the chemicals you're using are safe, and you can ignore all those other expensive regulations.
b) I said business would start purchasing from cartels, *not* individual consumers. If you're wondering why businesses would risk legal trouble to do so, ask yourself why perfectly legal brothels in the Netherlands are still rife with human trafficking. Answer: Because it's profitable.
3) That's the hardline libertarian view. The more common view is that nobody lives in a bubble, and that one guy's choices can effect everyone. it is reasonable to restrict a few of the less usual freedoms when they threaten public safety, and drain.
But I doubt we'll ever agree on that, so let's call it moot.
4) a) It's not impossible. If something is 99% likely, and fits in with everything we've observed so far, then stating it as fact is reasonable. Arguing against it is just stubbornness, not logic.
b) What's ignorant is to say: We have two bad things! That means we should add another, right? The "alcohol is worse" argument is a tired one.",10,1,No
4898,"marijuana legalization","No it should not. I have seen people get really messed up with 'weed' even though everyone seems to think its harmless.

Agree that maybe it should be decriminalized",10,1,No
1118,"marijuana legalization","Keep it up. These statements are the reason why marijuana will stay illegal. Just because something was legal a long time ago doesnt give us the reason to legalize it.

If they are so in fact stupid how do you know that they weren't stupid before they started smoking?

You should smoke a Joint sometime and tell me how your views on right-wing policy look.
You can state that marijuana alters your current perception but do you have any evidence that shows that marijuana affects intelligence?",10,1,No
5052,"marijuana legalization","No it should not. For all the people who do smoke, like myself, this will be a bad thing, because the government loves to do one thing. MAKE TAXES!

1968,"marijuana legalization","I don't really think that there's any need to take the time to legalize marijuana, since it's already illegal. It's obviously not good for you, as millions of scientists have proved. If you wanna kill your brain by doing it, go right ahead. It's just the fact that you have to sneak it around and break the law to do it. It's like a punishment for doing the wrong thing, like when your parents would spank you when you were younger; same deal, just a bigger issue.",10,1,No

1969,"marijuana legalization","First of all weed is a drug and causes not less harm than cigarets or alcohol, also marijuana often becomes a step-drug to other drugs. There aren't a man who died because of the weed? Well yeah, but there are many dead addicts who started from WEED. Marijuana causes addiction! And marijuana addiction causes and is caused by many problems including : unhappiness, crime, divorce, major illness. And for example you are suffering from depression and your doctor prescribes you marijuana. After smoking you feel better, happy, but you feel like that just when the effect lasts. When it ends you need to smoke again. People, who are genetically predisposed to addiction, can easily progress to other, harder drugs. Most of the profit, that gangs make, is from marijuana. So if the government would become as gangsters and sell the weed. Gangsters would have to find another source of getting money. Probably they would sell harder drugs more easily and widely, they would commit more crimes. We have two really big exact problems of similar cases - Alcohol and tobacco legalization. We can't handle these problems. There are many murders,robberies and other crimes committed by drunk people. Also many innocent people dies in car accidents, caused by drunk people. Many people want to quit smoking but they can't and many young, under-aged people are starting smoking. We can't handle these two things, so why to add another one?",10,1,disagree
